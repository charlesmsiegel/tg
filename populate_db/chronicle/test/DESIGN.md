## Setting Elements

These represent events or situations that differ from the default World of Darkness setting:

1. **The Silicon Pact** - In 1995, the major supernatural factions of Seattle formed an uneasy truce to prevent their conflicts from disrupting the tech industry boom. This pact is fraying as tensions rise.

2. **The Needle's Shadow** - The Space Needle serves as neutral ground where representatives of different factions can meet. It's protected by ancient wards that predate the structure itself.

3. **Underground Seattle** - The abandoned underground city beneath Pioneer Square has become a haven for those who don't fit into the surface politics. It's technically unclaimed territory.

4. **Microsoft's Secret** - A cabal of technomancers embedded in major tech companies has been quietly advancing the Digital Web's influence. Other factions are just now becoming aware of this.

5. **The Emerald Court's Decline** - The local Changeling freehold has been slowly dying as Seattle's dreamers became obsessed with practical tech pursuits rather than creativity for its own sake.

6. **The Sound's Depths** - Puget Sound holds secrets. Ships occasionally go missing, and strange things wash ashore. The Garou know something lurks there but won't speak of it.

7. **Rain City Wraiths** - Seattle's perpetual gray weather creates a thin Shroud, making it easier for the dead to interact with the living. Ghost sightings are common but dismissed as urban legend.

8. **The Coffee Conspiracy** - The explosive growth of Seattle's coffee culture wasn't entirely natural. Certain parties have been using it to distribute subtle alchemical compounds.
