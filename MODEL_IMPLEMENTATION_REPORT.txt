================================================================================
SECTION 6: CRITICAL GAPS & MISSING IMPLEMENTATIONS
================================================================================

HIGH PRIORITY (Must Have):
1. DEMON GAME LINE - COMPLETELY UNIMPLEMENTED
   Missing: Admin registration, Views, URLs, Templates for 9 models
   Models: Demon, DtFHuman, DemonFaction, DemonHouse, Visage, Lore, 
           Pact, Thrall, Thorn
   Status: Models defined but no UI/admin functionality
   Work Required: Full CRUD implementation

2. WRAITH LOCATIONS - PARTIAL
   Missing: Haunt, Necropolis not in admin or views
   Status: Models defined, not exposed in admin or UI
   Work Required: Admin registration + basic CRUD

3. GAME APP MODELS - LIMITED
   Missing: Journal/JournalEntry not in admin
   Missing: Week, WeeklyXPRequest UIs (basic crud only)
   Status: Functional but hidden from admin
   Work Required: Admin registration for game management

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
4. Game App CRUD Operations
   - Post management (create/update/delete)
   - XP Request workflows
   - Scene management UX

5. Core App HouseRule
   - No views/templates exist
   - Admin-only functionality

LOW PRIORITY (Enhancement):
6. Wraith Arcanos - no list view
7. Demon Lore hierarchy - needs better organization
8. Some trait models lack list views
