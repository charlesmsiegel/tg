## Multiple Backgrounds

A chantry may have multiple separate instances of the same Background:
- Multiple Nodes at different locations
- Multiple Libraries with different foci
- Multiple Sanctums for different members

Each instance is purchased and tracked separately.

## Background Integration

When designing a chantry:
1. Determine point budget
2. Prioritize essential backgrounds (Node for Q, Library for research)
3. Calculate costs to stay within budget
4. Create detailed files via appropriate skills
5. Link all backgrounds in main chantry document
