# Horizon Realm Merits and Flaws

## Merits

### Quintessence Efficient (7 pts)
Halves (round down) base maintenance cost. **May be purchased multiple times.** Each application halves current maintenance.

Example: Rank 5 (5 Q/mo) → first application: 2 Q/mo → second: 1 Q/mo → third: 0 Q/mo

### Genius Locus (5 pts)
Realm is intelligent with Attributes and Abilities.
- Attributes: 3 build pts each (start at 0)

- Cannot make rolls at 0
- Can communicate, perceive, control Realm features

### Spiritual Abode (2 pts)
Powerful spirit lives in Realm and defends it. Spirit's goals align with owners. Attracts visitors seeking the spirit.

### Has a Subrealm (5 pts)
Contains a smaller Subrealm. Subrealm pays 1/10 (min 1) maintenance to this Realm. Obligation to defend. **Cannot take for Rank ≤ 2.** Subrealm must be lower rank.

### Deep Space/Umbral (4 pts)
Exists in Deep Umbra or Deep Space. Extremely inaccessible without direct portal. Requires Spirit 5 to reach via travel.

### Astral (3 pts)
Exists in High Umbra/Maya/Dreaming. Accessible via Astral Projection. Intellectual/conceptual spirits. If Dreaming, must also have Chimerical Structure.

### Shadow (3 pts)
Exists in Low Umbra (realm of Dead). Inhabitants are wraiths and memories. Requires travel through Tempest without portal.

### Mobile (5 pts)
Realm can be steered and controlled.
- With Genius Locus: Self-directs
- Without: Requires pilot (Int + Cosmology diff 8, then Arete roll)
- Between Umbral regions: Difficulty 9
- Speed: Move up to Size rating in "zones" per day

### Chimerical Structure (4 pts)
Significant chimerical reality within. Changelings interact fully, Cantrips work. Chimerical beings count under Ephemera.

### Penumbra (4 pts)
Has Penumbra instead of Pericarp. Spirit 3 to cross (instead of Spirit 5). Reflections visible from Penumbra.

### Portal to Elsewhere (3-5 pts)
- 3 pts: Portal to Horizon Realm in Near Umbra
- 4 pts: Portal to any Near Umbral Realm (High/Middle/Low)
- 5 pts: Portal to Deep Umbral Realm

**May be purchased multiple times.**

### Bountiful (1-5 pts)
Realm produces survival resources naturally.

| Cost | Level | Effect |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Basic | Simple food/water, small population |
| 2 | Comfortable | Diverse food, basic materials, medium population |
| 3 | Abundant | All basic needs, occasional luxury, large population |
| 4 | Cornucopia | Wealth of resources, rare materials sometimes, any population |
| 5 | Paradise | Anything desired manifests, precious materials form |

**Incompatible with Environment 1** (unless specifically lush)

### Stable Resonance (3 pts)
Resonance doesn't drift or change regardless of use/inhabitants. Useful for research requiring consistent conditions.

### Self-Repairing (6 pts)
Heals damage automatically. Minor damage: days. Major damage: weeks to months. Requires base maintenance to function.

### Hidden Egress (2 pts each)
Secret escape routes. Appears only to those who know secret. Difficult to find even with magic (Awareness + Enigmas diff 9). **May be purchased multiple times.**

### Anchor to Node (3 pts)
Anchored to material world Node. Node rating = Q/mo toward maintenance.
**Drawback**: If Node destroyed/corrupted, Realm becomes unstable (Mutable stability for 1 year).

### Training Ground (5 pts)
Enhanced magical practice.
- XP costs for new Sphere levels reduced by 1 (min 1)
- Research time for rotes halved
- Teaching grants +1 die
- Apprentices advance 25% faster

### Sympathetic Connection (4 pts)
Strong connection to Primary Earthly Connection.
- Sense major events there (Per + Awareness diff 7)
- New portals to that location: -2 difficulty

**Drawback**: If connection location destroyed/corrupted, Realm may suffer.

### Morphic (6 pts)
Owners can actively reshape Realm with extended magic.
- Alter Environment, geography, buildings
- Requires extended ritual (min 1 week)
- No additional Quintessence cost
- Changes persist

**Cannot change**: Size, Rank, Merits/Flaws. Cannot exceed Environment rating.

### Planar Affinity (3 pts)
Strong connection to specific Umbral region (High/Low/Deep Umbra, Maya, Dreaming, Shadowlands, specific Deep Realm).
- Travel to/from that plane: -2 difficulty
- Spirits from that plane find Realm easily
- Some characteristics manifest
- Can sometimes perceive events in connected plane

## Flaws

### Inaccessible (-4 pts)
No access points to Earth (removes free one). Requires long Umbral trek + Spirit 5 to breach Pericarp.

### Former Spiritual Abode (-2 pts)
Powerful spirit once lived here, now destroyed/driven away. Spirit (or related) claims Realm and will attempt to press claim.

### Subrealm (-5 pts)
Contained within larger Realm. Must pay 1/10 (min 1) Q/mo to larger Realm. If larger Realm fails, this withers unless freed. **Cannot take for Rank ≥ 8.**

### Bleeding Out (-7 pts)
Damaged by Avatar Storm. Spiritual injury bleeds Quintessence. **Doubles base maintenance.** Physical/spiritual damage never fully heals.

**Order of Operations**: Apply Bleeding Out first, THEN Quintessence Efficient.

### Unstable Borders (-3 pts)
Boundaries shift unpredictably. Size varies ±1 randomly.
- Monthly roll 1d10: 1-3 shrinks, 4-7 stable, 8-10 expands
- Lost areas return eventually but altered
- Disorienting for inhabitants

### Parasitic (-5 pts)
Drains Quintessence from visitors. All visitors (except owners) lose 1 Q/week. Drained Q is lost, doesn't contribute to maintenance.

### Haunted (Variable)

| Cost | Level | Effect |
|------|-------|--------|
| -2 | Minor | Nuisance spirits, sometimes helpful |
| -3 | Persistent | Constant disturbances, minor hexes, stolen items |
| -4 | Dangerous | Hostile actions, can harm visitors |
| -5 | Malevolent | Actively tries to harm/corrupt, may be powerful bound entity |

### Dying (-8 pts)
Slowly collapsing. **Triples maintenance** to keep stable. If maintenance lapses, Size decreases 1/month. Environment degrades. Will cease to exist without extraordinary measures.

### Cursed (Variable)
Supernatural curse affecting all within.

| Cost | Examples |
|------|----------|
| -2 | Must speak truth, can't harm living, technology fails |
| -3 | Can't stay > 1 month, specific Sphere doesn't work |
| -4 | Visitors age 1 year/week, violence rebounds |
| -5 | Slow corruption (temp derangement/month), Paradox doubled |
| -6 | Life drains (1 HL/week), Nephandi enter freely |

Curse is fundamental—removing it may destroy Realm.

### Technocratic Interest (-3 pts)
Technocracy knows about and monitors Realm. Periodic surveillance, occasional raids (yearly or when activity detected), infiltration attempts.

### Nephandi Taint (-4 pts)
Corrupted by Nephandi influence. Subtle wrongness permeates. Extended stay risks Avatar corruption (Willpower diff 7/month, fail = temp derangement). Nephandi find it easier to locate/enter. Qlippothic imagery in some areas.

### Paradox Scarred (-5 pts)
Suffers from Paradox manifestations.
- Random flares (1d10/week: 10 = manifestation)
- Paradox backlash +1 worse
- Paradox spirits sometimes manifest spontaneously
- Reality visibly unstable

### Divided Ownership (-3 pts)
Multiple factions claim legitimate ownership. At least two groups have valid claim. Must negotiate, share, or defend constantly.

### Hostile Native Spirits (-4 pts)
Original spirit inhabitants resent mage presence. Sabotage, attacks, harassment. May ally with enemies. **Requires Ephemera 2+.**

## Combination Notes

- **Quintessence Efficient** stacks (each halves current)
- **Bleeding Out + Quintessence Efficient**: Apply Bleeding Out first
- **Has Subrealm** requires Rank 3+
- **Subrealm (Flaw)** requires Rank ≤ 7
- **Bountiful** incompatible with barren Environment 1
- **Astral + Dreaming** requires Chimerical Structure
- **Anchor to Node** creates dependency—Node destruction causes instability
