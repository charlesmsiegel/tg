## [Rote Name]

**Practice:** [Practice name]

**Spheres:** [Requirements, e.g., "Forces 3, Prime 2"]

**Cost:** [Total Sphere dots] points

**[Attribute] + [Ability]**

*[Flavor description: 1-2 paragraphs describing what the effect accomplishes from a story perspective. How does the mage perform this rote? What instruments do they use? What rituals, gestures, or preparations? Evoke the feel of the magick and the tradition performing it.]*

**System:** [Mechanical information]
- Successes needed and what each accomplishes
- Duration and range
- Vulgar or coincidental (note Reality Zones may alter this)
- Any special mechanical considerations
- Paradox guidance

## Example Rote

## Digital Phantom

**Practice:** Reality Hacking

**Spheres:** Correspondence 2, Forces 2

**Cost:** 4 points

**Intelligence + Computer**

*The Virtual Adept opens a terminal window, fingers dancing across the keyboard as lines of code scroll past. Security feeds, traffic cameras, ATM machines—all just nodes on the same network to someone who understands the underlying architecture. The Adept doesn't hack the camera; they convince reality that they were always authorized to view its feed. A progress bar appears, purely for aesthetic satisfaction, and suddenly a dozen camera feeds tile across the screen.*

**System:** The mage can perceive through any electronic surveillance device within sensory range (Correspondence 2), viewing its output as if looking at a monitor displaying the feed. Each success allows viewing one additional camera or extends range by one zone. The effect is coincidental when the mage has a plausible reason to access such feeds (IT professional, security consultant) and vulgar otherwise. Duration is one scene unless extended with additional successes. The mage cannot control the cameras—only view their existing feeds.

- **Practice**: Must match the mage's paradigm
- **Spheres**: Minimum required; don't over-specify
- **Attribute + Ability**: The Ability must be associated with the Practice
- **Flavor**: Specific to the tradition, describes the "how"
- **System**: Dry mechanics, covers edge cases, Paradox guidance
