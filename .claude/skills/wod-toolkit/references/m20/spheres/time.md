# Time (The Sphere of Temporal Manipulation)

*The most dangerous and paradox-prone Sphere*

## Level 1: Time Sense

**Capabilities:**
- Always know the exact current time
- Detect temporal disturbances and Time magick ripples
- Sense when time has been altered
- Perfect timing for mundane tasks (-1 to -3 difficulty)

**Perfect Moment:** Can lower difficulty of Attribute + Ability rolls by successes rolled (max -3). Cannot be used on Arete rolls during casting, but CAN be used to prepare rituals ahead of time.

## Level 2: Past & Future Sight

**Capabilities:**
- See into the past (hindsight)
- See possible futures (prophecy—unreliable)
- Conceal your own Time magick from detection
- "Thicken the walls of time" (subtract successes from others' Time effects)

**Prophecy Limitations:**
- The future is NOT fixed
- Visions show probabilities, not certainties
- Multiple possible timelines exist
- Generally coincidental for first 5 successes

**Thickening Time:** Each success subtracts one from other mages' Time attempts. Coincidental for first 5 successes; after that creates weird quirks and becomes vulgar.

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Time 2 + Mind 3/4: Total recall (vivid past memory retrieval)
- Time 2 + Mind 2: Prophecy combined with emotional impressions

## Level 3: Time Contraction & Dilation

**Capabilities:**
- Speed up time for yourself (extra actions)
- Slow down others
- "Bullet time" effects
- Rewind time (ALWAYS vulgar, +3 difficulty)
- Age or de-age things (with appropriate Pattern Sphere)

**Extra Actions:** 2 successes per additional action
- 1-2 extra actions: may be coincidental (burst of speed)
- 3+ extra actions: vulgar

**Rewinding Time:**
- +3 difficulty ALWAYS
- ALWAYS vulgar, even in Sanctums or solitude
- Paradox stacks: 1 layer per turn rewound
- Changes to the past create unpredictable ripples

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Time 3 + Life 3/4: Age or de-age living beings (always vulgar, +3 diff)
- Time 3 + Matter 2: Age or restore objects
- Time 3 + Entropy 3: Slow decay

**CRITICAL: Repeated Time Effects**
Each successive Time effect in a scene must beat the successes of the previous one (except simple perception or speed-up effects).

## Level 4: Time Determinism

**Capabilities:**
- Freeze time completely (time bubbles)
- Set trigger conditions for effects
- Create anchor points for time travel
- Put things into temporal suspension
- Install mental triggers that activate later (with Mind)

**Anchor Points:**
- Create "save points" to return to
- Requires returning physically to the anchor
- Adding Correspondence 4 allows return from any location
- Can be spotted by anyone with Time 1+

**Freezing Time:**
- Base successes depend on size of action frozen (1 for teacup, 5-10 for trainwreck)
- Add successes for duration
- Any outside interaction breaks the freeze
- Caster can dispel at will

**Temporal Suspension:** Add another Sphere to freeze specific patterns:
- Time 4 + Life 3/4: Freeze biological processes
- Time 4 + Matter 4: Freeze objects in time
- Time 4 + Mind 4: Hold a thought or mental state
- Time 4 + Forces 4: Freeze energy in stasis
- Time 4 + Entropy 4: Halt decay
- Time 4 + Corr 4: Bind location in stasis
- Time 4 + Spirit 5: Lock spirit in timeless state

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Time 4 + Mind 4: Trigger-conditioning (mental commands activate later)
- Time 4 + Corr 4: Return to anchor from anywhere
- Time 4 + Life 4 + Prime 2: Stasis preservation (Frankenstein-style)

## Level 5: Time Travel & Immunity

**Capabilities:**
- Travel through time (past or future)
- Step outside the timestream completely
- Time immunity (unaffected by external time)
- Edit the timeline (extreme consequences)

**Time Travel Paradox Stacking:**
| Duration | Paradox Layers |
|----------|----------------|
| Turns | 1 per turn |
| Intervals | 2 per interval on chart |
| Years | Massive accumulation |

**Time-Sphere Timeline (Successes):**
| Duration | Successes |
|----------|-----------|
| Turns | 2 per turn |
| Minutes | 3 |
| Hours | 4 |
| Days | 5 |
| Weeks | 6 |
| Months | 7 |
| Years | 8 |
| Decades | 9 |
| Centuries | 10+ |

**Sidestepping Time (Time 5):**
- Step laterally outside timestream
- Immune to external effects
- Internal processes continue normally (poison, disease, injury)
- World doesn't experience your touch until Duration ends
- Can interact selectively

**All Time 5 Effects Are Vulgar.** Always. No exceptions.

**Time Travel Consequences:**
- Changes ripple unpredictably
- Paradox backlash may strand mage in alternate timeline
- May trigger reverse aging, time-freezes, Paradox entities
- Absolute erasure from reality is possible

**Aging Night-Folk:**
Night-Folk cannot be aged out of existence. The spell inflicts usual lethal damage but:
- Vampires/mummies remain essentially unmoved
- Werecreatures/fae mystically "heal" lost years
- Spirits are completely immune
Requires the usual Sphere combinations to affect them at all (Life + Matter for vampires, Life + Spirit for werecreatures, etc.).

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Time 5 + Life 5: Age Night-Folk (limited effect)
- Time 5 + Mind 5 + Spirit 5: Full resurrection with personality reboot

**Feats of Time Magick (Successes):**
| Feat | Successes |
|------|-----------|
| Simple (falling teacup) | 1 |
| Standard | 2-3 |
| Difficult (car crash) | 4-5 |
| Impressive | 5-9 |
| Mighty (trainwreck) | 10-14 |
| Outlandish | 15-19 |
| Godlike (timeline editing) | 20+ |
