# Life (The Sphere of Living Patterns)

*The Pattern Sphere governing all organic matter*

## Level 1: Sense Life

**Capabilities:**
- Sense all living things in your vicinity
- Detect health, age, disease, physical state
- Perceive biological processes
- Diagnose injuries and illness
- Sense life force and vitality

## Level 2: Alter Simple Life/Self

**Capabilities:**
- Alter simple organisms (invertebrates, plants, microbes)
- Heal yourself (bashing and lethal damage)
- Cosmetic self-changes (hair color, minor features)
- Cause/cure disease in simple organisms
- Adjust your own body chemistry (pheromones, endorphins)

**Healing Self:** One success heals one health level (extended roll possible)

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Life 2 + Prime 2: Animate corpse (recently dead tissue)
- Life 2 + Forces 2: Make yourself invisible

**Chemistry Tweaking:**
- Boost pheromone production
- Augment endorphins/testosterone
- Acts as coincidental modifier for mundane rolls (-1 to -3 difficulty)

## Level 3: Alter Self/Transform Simple Life/Heal Others

**Capabilities:**
- Minor alterations to own shape (claws, fangs, gills)
- Transform simple organisms into other forms
- Heal others (bashing and lethal)
- Harm others
- Add features to yourself (wings, extra limbs—vulgar)
- Boost/lower Physical Attributes (one dot per success, max 5)
- Soak aggravated damage

**Shapechanging Reference:**
- Minor shifts (claws, cosmetic): Life 3
- Major transformation (animal form): Life 4
- Perfect metamorphosis: Life 5
- On others: One rank higher

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Life 3 + Prime 2: Create simple living organisms
- Life 3 + Spirit 2: Call upon spiritual essence (totem powers)
- Life 3 + Forces 3 + Prime 2: Fire-breathing or exotic abilities
- Life 3 + Mind 3: Heal fae creatures
- Life 3 + Matter 2: Heal vampires
- Life 3 + Spirit 2: Heal werecreatures

**Partial Transformations:** At least half the usual successes. Growing jaguar claws on human arms = 1 success for self, 2 for others.

## Level 4: Alter Complex Life/Transform Self

**Capabilities:**
- Alter other complex organisms (humans, animals)
- Transform yourself into other creatures (full animal forms)
- Major body modifications on others
- Rot bodies directly
- Duplicate bodies (with Mind and Correspondence)

**Transformation Successes:**
| Change | Successes |
|--------|-----------|
| Self to similar shape | 2 |
| Self to radically different | 3 |
| Other to similar shape | 4 |
| Other to radically different | 5+ |

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Life 4 + Spirit 4: Force werecreatures to hold form
- Life 4 + Mind 2: Maintain consciousness across multiple forms
- Life 4 + Matter 2: Transform living beings with tech components

**Risk of Sublimation:** Spending too long in radically different form risks losing identity:
- 1 Willpower per day in animal form
- 1 Willpower every 3 days in similar human form
- Can "purchase" form with 2 XP to avoid this

**Imperfect Shapechanging:** Life 4 transformations may have flaws or quirks.

## Level 5: Transform/Create Complex Life

**Capabilities:**
- Perfect metamorphosis (retain mind in any form)
- Create complex life from nothing (with Prime 2)
- Split into multiple living selves
- Any transformation on any living being
- Duplicate your body

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Life 5 + Prime 2: Create complex organisms
- Life 5 + Mind 5 + Prime 2: Create sentient life with consciousness
- Life 5 + Mind 5 + Spirit 5 + Prime 2: Create life with a soul
- Life 5 + Matter 4 + Prime 2: Full Frankencritters
- Life 5 + Corr 4 + Mind 2: Multiple simultaneous selves

**Creating Complex Life Requirements:**
- Body: Life 5
- Consciousness: Mind 5
- Energy: Prime 2
- Soul (optional): Spirit 5
- Just a spirit-puppet: Life 5 + Spirit 4 + Prime 2

**Cloning:** Life 5 + Mind 5 + Prime 2 (often with Time 3 to speed growth). Clone needs training/adjustment period unless imprinted with Mind 5.

**Night-Folk Healing:**
| Creature | Spheres |
|----------|---------|
| Vampires | Life 3 + Matter 2 |
| Werecreatures | Life 3 + Spirit 2 |
| Fae/Changelings | Life 3 + Mind 3 |

**Permanent Changes:** 4-6 successes for self, 8-10 for others. Can still be undone by caster or countered by another Life mage.
