# Matter (The Sphere of Inanimate Patterns)

*The Pattern Sphere governing non-living physical substances*

## Level 1: Matter Perceptions

**Capabilities:**
- Analyze composition and structure of materials
- Understand molecular and atomic properties
- Detect hidden compartments and structural weaknesses
- Sense the history and age of objects
- Perceive material flaws

## Level 2: Basic Transmutation

**Capabilities:**
- Transform one substance into another of similar properties
- Lead to gold (same state, similar atomic weight)
- Basic alchemy
- Reshape solids while maintaining their nature
- Animate bones (with Prime 2)

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Matter 2 + Prime 2: Animate bones
- Matter 2 + Life 3: Heal vampires
- Matter 2 + Forces 2: Affect technological devices

**Key Limitation:** Cannot change state (solid to liquid) or add new properties—that requires Matter 3+.

## Level 3: Alter Form/Conjure Matter

**Capabilities:**
- Change form AND properties during transmutation
- Mend or break objects
- Conjure solid materials from nothing (with Prime 2)
- Change states (ice to water to steam)
- Create simple objects (rocks, basic tools)

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Matter 3 + Prime 2: Conjure any simple solid material
- Matter 3 + Forces 2: Create objects with stored kinetic energy
- Matter 3 + Life 4: Lock bent physics onto a living being

**Locking Effects:** To have a Forces or other effect "travel" with an object (deflection field on armor, etc.), use Matter 2+ to lock it to the Pattern.

## Level 4: Complex Transmutation

**Capabilities:**
- Create composite materials and complex machinery
- Build functioning technology
- Transform complex alloys and compounds
- Create electronics, clockwork, vehicles

**Complexity Guide:**
| Object | Matter Rank |
|--------|-------------|
| Simple rock | Matter 2 |
| Complex alloy | Matter 3-4 |
| Working car | Matter 4 + Forces 3/Prime 2 (power) |
| Laptop | Matter 4 |
| Advanced technology | Matter 4-5 |

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Matter 4 + Forces 3 + Prime 2: Create powered devices
- Matter 4 + Life 4 + Prime 2: Cybernetic implants

**Knowledge Requirements:** Creating sophisticated items (nerve gas, weapons-grade plutonium, electronics) may require appropriate Abilities (Science, Technology, etc.) and specialties.

## Level 5: Alter Any Properties

**Capabilities:**
- Create any substance with any properties
- Perfect matter control
- Transmute anything into anything
- Create impossible materials (harder than diamond, lighter than air)
- Earthquake magick (with Forces 5 + Entropy 3)

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Matter 5 + Prime 3: Create Periapts (permanent Quintessence batteries)
- Matter 5 + Forces 5 + Entropy 3: Earthquakes
- Matter 5 + Life 5: Create realms with functioning ecosystems

**Elements and Spheres Reference:**
| Element | Sphere |
|---------|--------|
| Fire, light, heat, sound, electricity | Forces |
| Earth, stone, metal, wood, water | Matter |
| Living wood, plants | Life |
| Air, wind | Forces (Matter if solid air/vacuum) |
| Ephemera (spirit stuff) | Spirit |

**Transforming Between Element Types:** Must use both Spheres at appropriate ranks. Forces 2/Matter 1 will NOT turn glass into fire—needs Forces 3+/Matter 2+.
