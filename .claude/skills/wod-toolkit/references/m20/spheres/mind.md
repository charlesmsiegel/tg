| Unwilling target | Willpower +3 |
| Mage target | Willpower +3 (automatic) |
| Night-Folk | Often Willpower +5 |
| Multiple mages/Night-Folk | 8-10 |

**Resistance:** Target can roll Willpower (diff 6) to resist. Must beat mage's successes.

**Duration:** Effects erode when Duration ends unless conditioning makes them seem natural.

## Level 5: Untether Consciousness/Create Mind

**Capabilities:**
- Mass mind control
- Total alteration or erasure of personality
- Create new consciousnesses

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Mind 5 + Life 5 + Prime 2: Create sentient life
- Mind 5 + Spirit 4: Create zombies by displacing minds
- Mind 5 + Life 4 + Prime 2: Frankenstein-style creations with will

**Zombies (Mind 5 method):** Mind 5 + Spirit 4 displaces living person's mind with a ghost.

**Creating Consciousness:** Must be combined with Life 5 and Prime 2 minimum for a living creature. The creature needs extensive training unless you also use Mind 5 to imprint knowledge (still needs adjustment time).

**Generally Coincidental:** Mind effects are typically invisible to onlookers. Exception: if someone obviously starts seeing things after you stare at them, that's vulgar.
