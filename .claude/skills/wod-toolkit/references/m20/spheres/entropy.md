# Entropy (The Sphere of Fate, Fortune, and Decay)

*The Sphere of Chance and Destruction*

## Level 1: Sense Fate & Fortune

**Capabilities:**
- Sense flaws, weaknesses, structural vulnerabilities
- Detect lies (what TARGET believes is deliberate falsehood)
- Predict random outcomes (dice, cards, etc.)
- Spot weak points in objects, arguments, plans
- Perceive "threads of fate" around people/events
- Sense destiny and doom
- Detect bound oaths and curses

**Common Effects:**
- Find structural weaknesses before they fail
- Sense when someone is lying to you
- Predict which way dice will fall
- Perceive someone's "luck" or fortune

## Level 2: Control Probability

**Capabilities:**
- Manipulate random outcomes (gambling, coin flips)
- Create minor "coincidences"
- Adjust probabilities within existing circumstances
- Grant minor good or bad luck to self

**Key Limitation:** Effects must work with things already present. Cannot create circumstances, only influence existing probabilities.

**Common Effects:**
- Win at gambling (coincidental if subtle)
- Cause minor convenient coincidences
- Make equipment malfunction at key moments
- Arrange for a timely distraction

## Level 3: Affect Predictable Patterns

**Capabilities:**
- Decay or reinforce objects (non-living patterns)
- Grant good or bad luck to others
- Create dangerous "coincidences"
- Slow or halt entropy in inanimate matter
- Direct probability toward specific outcomes

**CRITICAL:** Entropy 3 does NOT directly damage living beings. It can lead people into hazardous circumstances (a speeding car, a weakened floor), but direct life-harming requires Entropy 4.

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Entropy 3 + Time 3: Slow decay over time
- Entropy 3 + Matter 3: Reinforce or weaken material structures
- Entropy 3 + Prime 2: Harm ghosts

**Blessings and Curses (Basic):**
- Simple fate: 1-3 successes
- Specific doom: 5+ successes (vulgar)
- Unlikely/elaborate fate: 10+ successes

**Storyteller Control:** The exact chain of events and nature of misfortune remains under Storyteller's control unless the player invokes vulgar magick.

## Level 4: Affect Life

**Capabilities:**
- Directly harm or heal living beings (aggravated damage)
- Control long-term luck and fortune
- Create lasting blessings or curses on people
- Rot bodies directly
- Bestow immediate fortune or misfortune

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Entropy 4 + Life 4: Lasting curses that follow the target
- Entropy 4 + Time 4: Triggered curses (activates on condition)
- Entropy 4 + Matter 4: Curse an object to bring misfortune

## Level 5: Affect Thought/Bind Oaths

**Capabilities:**
- Affect thoughts and ideas (conceptual entropy)
- Destroy or reinforce concepts, beliefs, memes
- Bind oaths with metaphysical consequences
- Scatter or focus mental processes
- Alter fundamental beliefs through probability

**Binding Oaths:**
- Target MUST agree willingly (no Mind compulsion)
- Breaking the oath triggers the curse automatically
- The target's own consciousness enforces the doom
- Permanent until fulfilled or caster releases it
- Can be spotted with Perception + Awareness by anyone using Entropy 1+

**Conceptual Entropy:**
- Reinforce or dismantle ideas within minds
- Requires social influence + magick (not Mind compulsion)
- Affects how targets perceive and conceptualize things
- Must approach target and establish influence through social rolls
