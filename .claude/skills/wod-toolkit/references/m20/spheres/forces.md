# Forces (The Sphere of Energy)

*The Pattern Sphere of energetic phenomena*

## Level 1: Perceive Forces

**Capabilities:**
- Perceive all types of energy: light, heat, sound, electricity, radiation, kinetic force, magnetism, gravity
- See in infrared, ultraviolet
- Hear ultrasonic/infrasonic frequencies
- Sense electrical fields and radio waves
- Detect kinetic energy and momentum

**Weight/Lifting:** Cannot lift anything at this level

## Level 2: Control Minor Forces

**Capabilities:**
- Manipulate existing forces (enhance, diminish, redirect)
- Create invisibility (bend light around something)
- Create silence (dampen sound waves)
- Adjust temperature within existing ranges
- Telekinesis (move objects—see weight limits)
- Basic flight (if you can justify the physics)

**Weight Limit:** Up to ~300 lbs (one human-sized target)

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Forces 2 + Life 2: Make a living creature invisible
- Forces 2 + Prime 2: Conjure illusory images (holograms)
- Forces 2 + Corr 2: Affect forces at a distance

**Combat Applications:**
- Each success can add/subtract 1 die from impact damage
- Can deflect projectiles
- Can enhance or diminish kinetic impacts

**Mystic Physics Tricks:**
- Reduce friction (make surfaces slippery)
- Adjust gravity locally
- Create cold/hot spots
- Disrupt cell phone signals
- Erase video recordings

## Level 3: Transmute Minor Forces

**Capabilities:**
- Transform one type of energy into another (fire to electricity)
- Conjure forces from "nothing" (requires Prime 2)
- Create fire, electricity, light, sound, etc.
- Telekinesis at greater weights
- Elemental attacks (fireballs, lightning bolts)

**Weight Limit:** Up to ~2 tons (an average car)

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Forces 3 + Prime 2: Conjure fire, lightning from nothing
- Forces 3 + Life 3: Transform body into elemental energy
- Forces 3 + Matter 2: Transform forces into solid matter

**Damage Bonus:** Forces automatically adds +1 success to damage rolls

**Blackout Systems:**
- Small areas: Forces 2 + few successes
- Large systems: Higher ranks + more successes
- City-wide: Forces 5 + many successes
- May also need Correspondence (reach) and/or Matter (damage machines)

## Level 4: Control Major Forces

**Capabilities:**
- Manipulate weather patterns
- Control large-scale forces (mile-scale effects)
- Create storms from existing conditions
- Lift small buildings
- Major elemental transformations

**Weight Limit:** Small buildings

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Forces 4 + Prime 3 + Matter 2: Dangerous storms with hazards
- Forces 4 + Corr 4: Open elemental gates
- Forces 4 + Entropy 3: Control storm behavior and probability

**Weather-Witching:**
- Forces 4 + Entropy 3: Strong "suggestions" to existing weather
- Takes hours to manifest unless vulgar
- Weather follows natural tendencies of existing climate

## Level 5: Transmute Major Forces

**Capabilities:**
- Control any forces at massive scale
- Create region-scale effects
- Summon impossible weather (blizzards in summer)
- Earthquakes (with Matter 5 + Entropy 3)
- Conjure devastating infernos

**Weight Limit:** Most things this side of a mountain

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Forces 5 + Prime 4 + Entropy 3 + Matter 3: Create impossible weather
- Forces 5 + Matter 5 + Entropy 3: Earthquakes
- Forces 5 + Corr 5: Weather anywhere in the world

**Weather Summoning Requirements:**
| Storm Type | Spheres | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------|
| From existing | Forces 5 | Takes time |
| Dangerous storms | Forces 5 + Prime 3 + Matter 2 | Environmental hazards |
| Impossible weather | Forces 5 + Prime 4 + Entropy 3 + Matter 3 | Costs 1 Quint per Sphere dot |

**Willpower for Storms:** Must make Willpower rolls to maintain control of large weather fronts (difficulty based on storm severity: 5 for rain, 7 for thunderstorm, 9 for tornado).

**Earthquakes:** Forces 5 + Matter 5 + Entropy 3. Damage harms structures, not characters directly. See Bustin' Stuff rules in M20.
