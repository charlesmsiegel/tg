|----------|-----------|
| Within immediate perception | 1 |
| Line of sight | 2 |
| Very familiar place | 3 |
| Familiar place | 4 |
| Visited once | 5 |

## Vulgarity Guidelines

### Usually Coincidental
- All Rank 1 perception effects
- Subtle probability manipulation (Entropy 2-3)
- Healing when not witnessed
- Mind effects (invisible to onlookers)
- Minor telekinesis
- Enhancing existing conditions
- Teleporting when departure/arrival unseen
- "The Batman" (disappearing into darkness)

### Usually Vulgar Without Witnesses
- Teleportation
- Creating matter/forces/life from nothing
- Major shapeshifting
- Stepping sideways (Spirit 3)
- Most Time manipulation beyond perception

### Always Vulgar
- Rewinding time (+3 difficulty always)
- Obvious impossibilities witnessed by Sleepers
- Creating storms from nothing
- Raising the dead
- Flying without visible means
- Anything that obviously defies physics in plain view

## Mind Control Difficulties

| Target | Difficulty |
|--------|------------|
| Single target | Target's Willpower (min 4) |
| Compelling unwanted action | Willpower +3 |
| Mage target | Willpower +3 (automatic) |
| Night-Folk | Often Willpower +5 |
| Multiple mages/Night-Folk | 8-10 |

## Forces Weight Limits

| Rank | Lifting Capacity |
|------|------------------|
| Forces 1 | Cannot lift anything |
| Forces 2 | ~300 lbs (one human) |
| Forces 3 | ~2 tons (average car) |
| Forces 4 | Small buildings |
| Forces 5 | Most things this side of a mountain |

## Time Paradox Stacking

- **Turns:** 1 layer of Paradox per turn rewound
- **Intervals:** 2 layers per interval on timeline chart
- Rewinding time is ALWAYS vulgar, even in Sanctums

### Time-Sphere Timeline (Successes)

| Duration | Successes |
|----------|-----------|
| Turns | 2 per turn |
| Minutes | 3 |
| Hours | 4 |
| Days | 5 |
| Weeks | 6 |
| Months | 7 |
| Years | 8 |
| Decades | 9 |
| Centuries | 10+ |

## Extra Actions (Time 3)

- 2 successes per additional action
- 1-2 extra actions: may be coincidental
- 3+ extra actions: vulgar

## Repeated Time Effects

Each successive Time effect in a scene must beat the successes of the previous one (except simple perception or speed-up effects).

## Duration Chart

Successes determine how long effects last (Base Damage or Duration chart in M20 core).

## The Rule of Correspondence

A Correspondence Effect is limited to your Rank in Correspondence. You cannot use Mind 4 with Correspondence 2—you need Correspondence 4 to project Mind 4 effects at distance.

## Optional: Spirit-Based Focus

If your paradigm works through spiritual connection (shamanism, totem magic, etc.):
- Add Spirit 2 to other Sphere effects when calling upon spiritual essence
- Example: Shaman growing wolf fangs = Life 3 + Spirit 2
- Reflects magic coming THROUGH spiritual connection
