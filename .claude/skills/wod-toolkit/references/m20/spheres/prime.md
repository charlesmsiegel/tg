# Prime (The Sphere of Quintessence)

*The Sphere of raw magical energy and the foundations of reality*

## Level 1: Etheric Senses

**Capabilities:**
- Sense Quintessence and Resonance
- Perceive the flow of magical energy
- Detect enchanted items, Tass, and Nodes
- Use Nodes to draw Quintessence
- Consecrate items (make them "real" enough to affect spirits)
- See "auras" of magical energy
- Detect other mages' Effects

**Reflexive Quintessence:** Can draw up to Avatar rating in Quintessence per turn from personal stores or touching Tass/Periapts.

## Level 2: Weave Odyllic Force/Enchant Patterns

**Capabilities:**
- Fuel Patterns with Quintessence (conjure with Pattern Spheres)
- Add aggravated damage to attacks (1 Quintessence per hit)
- Weave the Body of Light (visible energy form)
- Alter your own aura
- Enchant weapons/armor to affect spirits
- Access Quintessence from Tass/Periapts you're touching

**THE PRIME 2 RULE (Critical):**
To conjure Pattern from nothing, combine Pattern Sphere 3+ with Prime 2:
- Forces 3 + Prime 2 → conjure fire, lightning, energy
- Matter 3 + Prime 2 → conjure solid objects
- Life 3 + Prime 2 → create simple organisms
- Mind 3 + Prime 2 → create mental constructs
- Spirit 3 + Prime 2 → create ephemera

**Body of Light:** Visible energy body. Does not grant astral travel—just appearance.

## Level 3: Channel Quintessence

**Capabilities:**
- Channel Quintessence between yourself and objects/people
- Create simple Wonders (temporary magical items)
- Create energy weapons from pure Quintessence
- Fuel ongoing effects
- Move Quintessence in/out of Periapts
- Revive the recently dead (with Life 4 + Spirit 4)

**Quintessence Weapons:** Cost 1 Quintessence per health level of damage.

**Channeling Limits:** Amount transferred = number of successes rolled.

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Prime 3 + Life 4 + Spirit 4: Revive someone who died within ~5 minutes
- Prime 3 + Spirit 3: Fuel spirit-world Effects

**Fueling Elements:** If a mage has Prime 3+, she can channel Quintessence to sustain elemental manifestations (fire without fuel, etc.). Generally 1-5 Quint per turn depending on intensity.

## Level 4: Expel/Drain Base Energy

**Capabilities:**
- Destroy objects by draining Quintessence (aggravated damage)
- Create permanent Wonders (Talismans, Devices)
- Drain energy from spirits
- Refine Tass (change its form/resonance)
- Create Tass from free-flowing Quintessence
- Draw Quintessence from Wellsprings (emotional events)
- Recharge Periapts at will

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Prime 4 + Spirit 4: Drain spirit Essence
- Prime 4 + [Effect Spheres]: Create Talismans
- Prime 4 + Forces 3: Convert incoming energy damage to Quintessence (1 Quint per health level)

**Wellsprings:** Areas of strong emotion generate free-flowing Quintessence. The Resonance must match your purpose (can't tap battle energy for peaceful purposes).

**Creating Tass:** Prime 4 shapes free-flowing Quintessence into material form. Tass depletes as used and the material disappears when empty.

## Level 5: Create/Destroy Nodes

**Capabilities:**
- Create Nodes from scratch
- Nullify Paradox
- Infuse or withdraw life force
- Destroy living beings by draining their Quintessence
- Create Periapts (permanent Quintessence batteries)

**Creating Nodes:** ~10 successes per dot in Node Background. Easier where Resonance already flows thick.

**Key Conjunctions:**
- Prime 5 + Life 5: Create Periapts from living tissue
- Prime 5 + Matter 5: Create Periapts from inanimate matter
- Prime 5 + Spirit 5: Disintegrate spirits completely
- Prime 5 + Spirit 5 + Corr 5: Create Horizon Realms

**Paradox Nullification:** See Mage 20 Paradox rules.

**Vulgarity Note:** Flows of 10+ Quintessence per turn create visible effects (bands of light, crackling bolts, etc.) and are vulgar. Smaller flows are typically coincidental.
