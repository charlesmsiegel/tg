# Key Decisions

Resolved conflicts and design decisions that guide toolkit behavior across all gamelines.

---

## Spirit & Umbra Mechanics

1. **Spirit Essence**: Rage + Gnosis + Willpower (W20 formula)
2. **Spirit Ranks**: Middle Umbra uses Incarna; High Umbra uses Lord/Preceptor
3. **Spirit templates**: Include BOTH Chiminage (W20) AND Ban (M20)
4. **Spectres**: Wr20 term only — NOT spirits (Shadow-consumed wraiths)
5. **Ancestor Spirits ≠ Wraiths**: Distinct categories
6. **Digital Web = CyberRealm**: Same place, different names
7. **The Dreaming**: Connected but separate from Umbra

## Vampire Lore

8. **Wr20 "Shadow" power**: Renamed to "Shade" (M20 has Shadow)
9. **Harbingers of Skulls**: Present in BOTH Sabbat AND Tal'Mahe'Ra (not contradictory)
10. **Old Clan Tzimisce**: Lack Vicissitude, use Koldunism; distinct from main Clan
11. **Maeghar**: New bloodline from fae-blooded Embraces; NOT Kiasyd
12. **Via Hyron (Path of the Hive)**: Anti-infernalist despite Baali association
13. **Cappadocian**: Historical clan (extinct); Harbingers are survivors, Apacia is rare exception
14. **Assamite Castes**: Warrior/Vizier/Sorcerer have distinct Disciplines and weaknesses
15. **Ritae ≠ Thaumaturgy**: Ritae are faith-powered blood magic, affected by blood magic resistance but NOT Thaumaturgy
16. **Gargoyle Fertility**: Ritual-created = infertile; Embraced = can Embrace (erases childe's memories)
17. **Blood Brothers**: Absolutely infertile in all ways (cannot Embrace, cannot create ghouls)
18. **Infernal Detection**: Powers only visible in aura when actively used (unless Karmic Sight)
19. **Anarch Blood Magic**: Four schools (Old Skool, New Age, Punk, Hacktivist) with distinct botch effects

## Mortal & Hunter Mechanics

20. **Psychic Healing vs Vampirism**: Cannot possess both Numina paths (mutually exclusive)
21. **Twilight Path prerequisite**: Requires Shroud Sense Merit
22. **Passed Life botches**: Always grant a Derangement; Derangements reduce difficulty
23. **Wild Hunt Great Feast**: Benefits last until following new moon; only one benefit at a time
24. **Reliquary binding**: Extended roll; Mediums get 2 auto-successes; difficulty = ghost's Willpower +2
25. **PIH Creatures ≠ Splats**: Cryptids, Ephemeral, Mythological, and Unfortunate are distinct from standard WoD splats
26. **HH2 Hunter Abilities**: Hunters use 13/9/5 (HH2 p.35); generic mortals use 11/7/4 — note as variant
27. **HH2 Humanity Cost**: Hunters use 2 freebies per dot (HH2 p.35); standard is 1 — note as variant
28. **Numina Hierarchy**: Wr20 > V20 for conflicting paths (Divination, Healing use Wr20 versions)

## NPC Guidelines

29. **Faces of Magick NPCs**: Use `m20.npcs` category, not book-specific categories; note source in `_meta`
30. **NPC Stats**: "Suggested" prefix indicates flexibility; adjust for chronicle power level
31. **NPC Connections**: All NPCs should connect to 2-4 others; no orphan nodes in networks
32. **Future Fates**: Use for metaplot-dependent NPC versions (e.g., Hyeonmyeong alive vs. reincarnated)

---

## Equipment & Items

33. **Weapon Stats Consistency**: Weapon mechanics (Diff, Damage, Concealability) are consistent across all gamelines; supernatural enhancements use game-specific rules (fetishes, wonders, treasures)
34. **Haven Background**: Uses Anarchs Unbound three-subcategory system (Luxury/Size/Security). May be individual or pooled with coterie. Replaces simple 1-5 scale.
