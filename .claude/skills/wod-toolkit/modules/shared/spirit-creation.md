# Spirit Creation Rules (Rites of the Blood Addition)

Quick rules for creating spirits for V20, compatible with all gamelines.

---

## Spirit Nature

Spirits are constructs born from the spirit realms, known to Hermetic practitioners as the Umbrood. They are NOT sentient in the traditional sense — they are reflections of the spirit world, perceived aspects of the universe interpreted through limited mortal perception.

**Key Implication**: This is why Presence (perception-based) works on spirits but Dominate (requires true sentience) does not.

## Quick Spirit Creation

### Step 1: Define Concept

Limit to a single category describable with a phrase:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Nature Spirit | Land, sea, wood, desert, river, mountain |
| Conceptual Spirit | Mathematics, war, mechanics, commerce, music |
| Inanimate Object | Computer, knife, jewelry, book, building |
| Emotional Spirit | Rage, sorrow, joy, fear |
| Urban Spirit | Traffic, graffiti, nightlife, poverty |

### Step 2: Determine Rank (1-5)

Rank determines base power level:

| Rank | Power Level | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Minor | Gaffling, small nature spirit |
| 2 | Notable | Established local spirit |
| 3 | Powerful | Jaggling, prominent spirit |
| 4 | Major | Regional power |
| 5 | Legendary | Incarna-level |

### Step 3: Calculate Base Stats

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Willpower** | Rank |
| **Base Dice Pool** | Rank × 2 |
| **Essence** (W20) | Rank × 5 |

### Step 4: Assign Disciplines/Powers

**One Discipline power per Rank**, based on concept.

| Spirit Type | Appropriate Disciplines |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Fire | Thaumaturgy: Lure of Flames |
| War | Potence, Celerity |
| Knowledge | Auspex |
| Death | Necromancy powers |
| Fear | Presence, Obfuscate |
| Nature | Animalism, Protean |

**Willpower fuels special abilities** (equivalent to blood points).

**Willpower regeneration**: Full pool restored every 24 hours.

### Step 5: Assign Abilities

**One Ability per Rank** related to concept:

| Spirit Type | Appropriate Abilities |
|-------------|----------------------|
| War | Brawl, Melee, Firearms, Survival |
| Knowledge | Academics, Investigation, Occult |
| Nature | Survival, Animal Ken |
| Technology | Computer, Science |

**Each Ability adds 2 dice** to base pool for relevant actions.

| Essence | 15 |

**Disciplines** (3 powers):
- Lure of Flames 1 (Hand of Flame)
