# Soulforging Module

Create soulforged items—objects made from wraith Corpus. The defining craft of the Underworld.

## Overview

Soulforging converts wraiths into raw plasm, then shapes that material into functional objects. One soul yields one part.

**Core mechanic**: Crafts Ability (requires specialty in soulforging for full effectiveness)

---

## Three Stages

| Stage | Roll | Difficulty | Time |
|-------|------|------------|------|
| **Appraising** | Manipulation + Crafts | Soul's Willpower | 1 hour (-10 min/success) |
| **Working** | Strength + Crafts | Soul's Stamina + 2 | Extended (1 hr/roll) |
| **Finishing** | Perception + Crafts | 8 | Extended (1 hr/roll) |

---

## Stage 1: Appraising

Assess the soul to determine optimal approach.

**Roll**: Manipulation + Crafts (difficulty = soul's Willpower)
- **Success**: Proceed normally
- **Failure**: All further rolls +1 difficulty
- **Time**: 1 hour, -10 min per success

---

## Stage 2: Working

Convert soul to plasm and shape into desired form.

**Roll**: Extended Strength + Crafts (difficulty = soul's Stamina + 2)

### Size Successes Required
| Successes | Size |
|-----------|------|
| 1 | Medium (Conceal T tool/weapon; armor jacket) |
| 2 | Non-concealable tool/weapon; breastplate |
| 3 | Small (Conceal J tool/weapon; shield/helmet) |
| 4 | Wraith-sized; full-body armor |
| 5 | Tiny (Conceal P tool/weapon) |

### Complexity Successes Required
| Successes | Complexity |
|-----------|------------|
| 1 | Basic functional shape; blunt implement |
| 2 | Crude mechanical part |
| 3 | Balanced/symmetrical; edged weapon |
| 4 | Wearable attire; aerodynamic; projectile |
| 5 | Precision mechanical part; flexible/jointed weapon |

**Examples**:
- Scimitar (Conceal T + edged weapon) = 4 successes
- Structural girder (wraith-sized + crude part) = 6 successes
- Obol (tiny + symmetrical) = 8 successes

**Interruption/Botch**: Ruins job; soul must cool before restart  
**3 Botches**: Must let soul cool (1 week); premature rework destroys it  
**Each Botch**: Introduces a crack

**Result**: "Rough and ready"—mechanical ratings -1, or +2 difficulty to use

---

## Stage 3: Finishing

Refine the item to full functionality.

**Roll**: Extended Perception + Crafts (difficulty 8)

### Finishing Effects
| Successes | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Eliminate "rough and ready" penalty |
| 2 | +1 damage (blunt weapons only) |
| 3 | -1 Dex penalty (armor, specific wearer) |
| 3 | Hidden compartment |
| 3 | +1 damage vs specific target type |
| 4 | +25% Corpus |
| 4 | +1 damage (edged weapons, all targets) |
| 5 | -1 Dex penalty (armor, all wearers) |
| 5 | Tool specialty (specific task) |
| 5 | Weapon specialty (combat maneuver) |
| 5 | Armor specialty (damage source) |
| 1-5 | Decorative features (by complexity) |

**Can pause**: Set aside indefinitely, resume later  
**Each Botch**: Introduces crack  
**3 Botches**: Destroys item

---

## Soulforging Styles

Crafts specialty determines style. Cannot switch mid-job.

### Nhudric (Traditional Artificer)
- **Roll**: May use Strength instead of specified Attribute
- **Bonus**: Increased Corpus only 2 successes (finishing); breaking requires Strength +1
- **Risk**: 3 botches during working = soul destroyed + 3 temp Angst to Shadow

### Zürcher (Alchemist)
- **Roll**: May use Perception instead of specified Attribute
- **Time**: Each roll takes 4 hours (not 1)
- **Bonus**: Specialties/decoration cost 1 less success; -1 difficulty to impress visually

### Rose Island (Independent/Usurer)
- **Roll**: May use Manipulation instead of specified Attribute
- **Bonus**: First botch doesn't add crack; +2 successes cancellation vs Oblivion; creatures of Oblivion +1 difficulty
- **Risk**: Each botch gives 3 temp Angst to Shadow

### Cachtice (Spectral)
- **Roll**: May use Manipulation instead of specified Attribute
- **Bonus**: May add specialty for only 1 success
- **Risk**: Botch destroys soul; learning grants 1 perm Angst; each job grants 2 temp Angst
- **Special**: Souls retain fragment of awareness (terrifying)

## Alloys

| Alloy | Requirements | Properties |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Soulsteel** | Base material | Standard soulforged item |
| **Stygian Steel** | Crafts ••••, 3x time | +Corpus, harder to break, aggravated damage |
| **Necropolis Steel** | Crafts •••, 2x time | +Corpus only |
| **Ash-Iron** | Crafts •••, 2x time, Great River tree | Luminescent white; armor Dex penalty -1 success; flexible weapons -1 attack difficulty |
| **Labyrinthine Adamas** | Crafts ••••• (••• for Spectre), 3x time | +50% Corpus; 2 Pathos/1 Angst = invisible (scene); agg damage (not to Spectres) |

---

## Cracks

Flaws from botches—spiritual defects, not physical.

| Crack | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Compelling** | Attracts specific entity type |
| **Fleeting** | Rolls/bounces into inconvenient places |
| **Lonely** | Gravitates toward other soulforged items |
| **Magnetic** | Bearer's Shadow obsesses over item |
| **Nihilistic** | Rolls toward nearest Nihil |
| **Somnambulistic** | Travels to nearest Slumbering wraith |
| **Transient** | Beings across Shroud react to presence |
| **Vocal** | Emits faint anguished whimpers |
| **Vulnerable** | Seeks destruction; attackers +1 die |
| **Weeping** | Seeps plasm; leaves salt stains |

---

## Forging Spectres

- **Difficulty**: All rolls +1
- **Botch**: Partially-forged Spectre breaks free
- **Weapons**: Deal aggravated damage
- **Armor**: +1 soak vs aggravated
- **Curse**: Once per session, bearer's Shadow may convert one 10 to 1

---

## Workshop Requirements

| Setup | Background |
|-------|------------|
| Permanent forge | Haunt •• + Relic ••• |
| Portable forge | Relic •••• (half wagonload) |

**Tools**: Forge, bellows, anvil, quenching trough, tongs, chisels, hammers, punches, drills, files, jigs, wire brushes, grinding stones
