# Guild Module

Reference for the Guilds of Stygia—organizations devoted to the study and teaching of Arcanoi.

## What are Guilds?

Guilds are societies of wraiths who practice and teach specific Arcanoi. They were once legal, then banned, and now operate in a gray area.

**Status**: Officially banned by the Dictum Mortuum, but tolerated in practice.
