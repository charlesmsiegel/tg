# Connaissance Module

The Arcanos of the Mirrorlands (Caribbean Shadowlands). Connaissance reflects the intimate relationship between Les Invisibles and their Shadows.

## Overview

Connaissance enables Serviteurs to:
- Work with their Shadows as allies
- Detect and communicate with Spectres (Baka)
- Strengthen mortal descendants (Les Chevaux)
- Create new Fetters
- Access Les Mysteres' power

**Key Difference**: Unlike Stygian wraiths, Les Invisibles treat Shadows as partners, not pure antagonists.

## Core Mechanic: Shadow Mounting

Before using many Connaissance arts, the Serviteur invites their Shadow to take temporary control.

**Roll**: Wits + Connaissance (difficulty = Shadow's permanent Angst)
- **1 success**: Indefinite period (Shadow chooses when to leave)
- **5 successes**: Host can eject Shadow any time after first round

**To Eject Early**: Contested roll
- Shadow rolls temporary Angst
- Serviteur rolls permanent Willpower
- If Serviteur wins: Shadow ejected immediately
- If Shadow ties or wins: Mounting continues

**Cost**: Each ejection attempt costs 1 Willpower (even successful ones)
**Benefit**: Successful mounting causes Shadow to lose 1 Angst
