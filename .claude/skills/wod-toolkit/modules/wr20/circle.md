# Circle Module

Create Circles (wraith groups) for W20—the basic social unit of the Restless.

## What is a Circle?

A Circle is a group of wraiths bound together by:
- Shared purpose or goals
- Mutual protection
- Common Fetters or Passions
- Circumstance (died together, same Reaper, etc.)

---

## Circle Types

| Type | Binding | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Circumstance** | Died together or similarly | Plane crash victims, murder spree |
| **Purpose** | Shared goal | Revenge seekers, protectors |
| **Location** | Same Haunt/territory | Neighborhood ghosts |
| **Faction** | Same Legion/Guild | Legion squad, Guild chapter |
| **Fetter** | Shared Fetters | Family members, workplace |

---

## Circle Benefits

### Mechanical
- Shared Haunt (pooled Background dots)
- Mutual defense pacts
- Resource sharing (Pathos, Relics)
- Combined Arcanos effects (some powers)

### Social
- Support against Shadows
- Witness for Transcendence attempts
- Political representation
- Collective memory preservation

## Creation Workflow

1. **Concept** — Circle's purpose and theme
2. **Members** — Create each wraith (or reference existing)
3. **Binding** — What holds them together?
4. **Shared Resources** — Pool Backgrounds if desired
5. **Shared Haunt** — Create communal space
6. **History** — How did they meet/form?
7. **Goals** — What does the Circle pursue?
8. **Internal Dynamics** — Relationships, tensions
9. **External Relations** — Allies, enemies, faction ties
10. **Validate**

## Shared Backgrounds

Circles can pool certain Backgrounds:

| Background | Shareable? | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| Haunt | Yes | Combined rating, shared space |
| Allies | Yes | Group contacts |
| Contacts | Yes | Information network |
| Status | No | Individual standing |
| Relic/Artifact | Partial | May be "Circle property" |
| Mentor | Partial | May teach whole Circle |

### Pooling Rules
- Total dots = sum of contributions
- Maximum rating: 5 (excess = special features)
- All contributors must agree
- Leaving Circle may forfeit contribution

## Circle Roles

Common informal roles within Circles:

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Leader** | Decision-maker, spokesperson |
| **Pardoner** | Shadow management, counseling |
| **Scout** | Reconnaissance, Argos specialist |
| **Enforcer** | Combat, protection |
| **Face** | Social interaction, negotiation |
| **Keeper** | Haunt maintenance, resources |
| **Lorekeeper** | History, knowledge, training |
