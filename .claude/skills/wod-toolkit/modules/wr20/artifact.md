## What is an Artifact?

An Artifact is a Relic that has been imbued with supernatural power:
- Functions beyond its original purpose
- Powered by Pathos or other energy
- May contain bound spirits or effects
- Created through Inhabit, Flux, or other Arcanoi

## Creation Methods

### Inhabit (Artificers)
- **Inhabit 5 (Claim)**: Create Artifacts from technology
- Most common method for modern items
- Often involves binding the wraith to the object

### Flux (Alchemists)
- Transform and enhance plasmic objects
- Can add or modify properties
- Often temporary unless stabilized

### Soulforging
- Dark art of forging wraith Corpus
- Creates permanent, powerful items
- Ethically abhorrent to many

### Found/Inherited
- Some Relics gain power over time
- Emotional resonance can empower objects
- Historical significance matters
