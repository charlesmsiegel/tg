# Harrowing Module

Design and run Harrowings—nightmare trials in the Labyrinth where wraiths face their Shadows.

## What is a Harrowing?

A Harrowing is:
- A journey into the Labyrinth (the maze beneath the Tempest)
- A psychological battle between Psyche and Shadow
- Triggered by trauma, Fetter loss, or Willpower depletion
- A trial that can lead to Transcendence or Oblivion

## Harrowing Triggers

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Willpower Loss** | Temporary Willpower reaches 0 |
| **Fetter Destruction** | A Fetter is completely destroyed |
| **Catharsis Failure** | Shadow wins extended Catharsis |
| **Entering a Nihil** | Voluntarily or involuntarily entering the Void |
| **Spectre Attack** | Certain Spectre powers |
| **Extreme Trauma** | Storyteller discretion |

## Harrowing Structure

### Act I: The Descent
- Wraith is pulled into the Labyrinth
- Environment reflects personal fears/guilts
- Shadow appears in dramatic form
- Stakes are established

### Act II: The Trial
- Series of challenges or confrontations
- Shadow tempts, threatens, or manipulates
- Psyche must make difficult choices
- Other entities may appear (Spectres, lost souls)

### Act III: The Resolution
- Final confrontation with Shadow
- Outcome determined by accumulated choices
- Wraith emerges changed (for better or worse)

## Harrowing Environments

The Labyrinth shapes itself to the wraith's psyche:

### Personal Hells
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Memory Loops** | Reliving worst moments |
| **Twisted Places** | Distorted familiar locations |
| **Abstract Horrors** | Pure psychological landscapes |
| **Shadow's Domain** | The Shadow's "home turf" |

### Common Elements
- Impossible geometry
- Symbolic imagery
- Time distortion
- Sensory overload or deprivation
- Appearances by the dead (real or imagined)

---

## Shadow Tactics During Harrowing

The Shadow has home advantage:

### Psychological Attacks
- Reveal shameful secrets
- Distort memories
- Impersonate loved ones
- Offer false salvation

### Environmental Manipulation
- Change the landscape
- Create obstacles
- Summon nightmares
- Control time perception

### Direct Confrontation
- Physical combat (using Shadow Traits)
- Use all Thorns freely
- Call on Dark Allies
- Manifest at full power

---

## Harrowing Mechanics

### Basic Resolution
- Extended contested roll
- Psyche: Willpower vs difficulty 6
- Shadow: Angst vs difficulty 6
- First to accumulate target successes wins

### Modifiers
| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Strong Passion relevant | -1 difficulty for Psyche |
| Dark Passion relevant | -1 difficulty for Shadow |
| Fetter nearby (mentally) | +1 die for Psyche |
| High permanent Angst | +1 die for Shadow |

### Stakes
| Outcome | Result |
|---------|--------|
| **Psyche Wins Decisively** | Remove 1 permanent Angst, possible Transcendence progress |
| **Psyche Wins** | Escape Harrowing, gain 1 Willpower |
| **Draw/Narrow Win** | Escape, no change |
| **Shadow Wins** | Gain 1 permanent Angst, possible Thorn |
| **Shadow Wins Decisively** | Gain 2 permanent Angst, Shadow chooses consequence |

## Designing a Harrowing

### Step 1: Identify the Trigger
What caused this Harrowing? This shapes the theme.

### Step 2: Choose the Environment
- Based on trigger and character history
- Should be personally meaningful
- Allow for exploration and confrontation

### Step 3: Plan Shadow Appearance
- How does the Shadow manifest?
- What form does it take?
- What is its opening move?

### Step 4: Create Challenges
- 3-5 significant scenes or tests
- Each should offer meaningful choice
- Tie to Passions, Fetters, or history

### Step 5: Determine Resolution Conditions
- How can Psyche win?
- How can Shadow win?
- What does escape look like?

## Running a Harrowing

### For Storytellers

**Pacing**
- Start disorienting, build intensity
- Allow moments of false hope
- Climax should feel earned

**Player Agency**
- Choices should matter
- Multiple paths to resolution
- Don't railroad to predetermined outcome

**Shadowguide Role**
- Shadowguide takes center stage
- Should push but not torture player
- Know when to back off

### For Shadowguides

**Goals During Harrowing**
- Create memorable, meaningful experience
- Push the character, not the player
- Make the Shadow feel real and dangerous
- Allow possibility of victory

**Techniques**
- Use character's history against them
- Twist their Passions
- Threaten their Fetters
- Offer tempting but poisonous deals

## Harrowing Outcomes

### Positive Outcomes
- **Insight**: Learn something about self/Shadow
- **Angst Reduction**: Permanent Angst decreases
- **Transcendence Step**: Progress toward escape
- **New Passion**: Emerge with renewed purpose

### Negative Outcomes
- **Angst Increase**: Shadow grows stronger
- **New Thorn**: Shadow gains new power
- **Fetter Damage**: Connections weakened
- **Catharsis**: Shadow seizes control upon exit

### Transcendence
Repeated Harrowing victories, combined with resolving Fetters and Passions, can lead to **Transcendence**—the ultimate escape from the cycle of death.
