# Dauntain Module

Create Dauntain characters for C20—changelings corrupted by Banality who hunt their own kind.

## What are Dauntain?

Dauntain are changelings who have been broken by Banality and now serve it. They hunt other fae, destroy freeholds, and spread the Endless Winter. They are tragic figures—once dreamers who now bring nightmare to their former kin.

## Dauntain vs. Kithain

| Aspect | Dauntain | Kithain |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Banality | Embraced | Resisted |
| Glamour | Twisted, painful | Nourishing |
| Arts | Corrupted versions | Normal |
| Purpose | Destroy the Dreaming | Protect the Dreaming |
| Iron | Can wield | Vulnerability |
| Fae Sight | Inverted (sees to destroy) | Normal |

---

## The Branding

Every Dauntain bears a **Brand**—a mark of their corruption that grants them power against the fae.

### Brand Types

| Brand | Effect | Appearance |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **The Iron Brand** | Can touch/wield cold iron | Metal scar or mark |
| **The Brand of Silence** | Immune to cantrips targeting them | Mouth sealed look |
| **The Brand of Darkness** | Can sense Glamour to destroy it | Shadow in eyes |
| **The Brand of Forgetting** | Causes Mists effect on touch | Faded, ghostly |
| **The Brand of Undoing** | Touch drains Glamour | Withered appearance |
| **The Brand of Winter** | Presence increases Banality | Frost-touched |

## Types of Dauntain

### The Twisted
Former changelings who broke under Banality. Still have their kith nature, but inverted.
- Retain Birthrights (corrupted versions)
- Frailties become "strengths"
- Seek to destroy what they once loved

### The Hollow
Changelings who underwent complete Undoing and were "rescued" by other Dauntain.
- Lost original kith identity
- Blank, empty personalities
- Follow other Dauntain's commands

### The Apostates
Changelings who chose to join the Dauntain willingly.
- May retain more personality
- Often have specific grudges
- Most dangerous (tactical thinking)

---

## Creation Approach

Dauntain are typically created as antagonist NPCs, but PC Dauntain are possible for specific chronicles.

### NPC Dauntain (Recommended)

Start with a Kithain character, then apply:
1. Invert personality (Legacies become dark mirror)
2. Apply Brand
3. Add Dauntain abilities
4. Define motivation for turning

### PC Dauntain (With ST Approval)

Use standard Kithain creation, then:
1. Swap Banality and Glamour starting values
2. Replace one Birthright with Brand
3. Arts work differently (see below)
4. Add Dauntain-specific Merits/Flaws

## Corrupted Arts

Dauntain use twisted versions of Arts powered by Banality rather than Glamour.

| Normal Art | Corrupted Version | Effect Change |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Chicanery | Obfuscation | Hides from fae sight, causes Mists |
| Primal | Blight | Kills plants, poisons nature |
| Soothsay | Despair | Predicts doom, curses with certainty |
| Sovereign | Domination | Commands through fear and Banality |
| Wayfare | Exile | Banishes, traps, prevents escape |

### Using Corrupted Arts
- Roll Banality instead of Glamour
- Cause Banality damage instead of normal effects
- Cannot create—only destroy or corrupt
