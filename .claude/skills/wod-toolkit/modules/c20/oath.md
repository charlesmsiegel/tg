# Oath Module

Create and document sworn oaths for C20—the magical contracts that bind changelings.

## What are Oaths?

Oaths are magically-binding promises. When a changeling swears an oath, Glamour itself enforces the terms. Breaking an oath has supernatural consequences.

## Oath Mechanics

### Swearing an Oath
1. Speak the oath aloud
2. Both parties must agree
3. Often requires witnesses
4. Spend Willpower to seal
5. Oath becomes binding

### Breaking an Oath
| Severity | Consequence |
|----------|-------------|
| Minor violation | Lose Willpower |
| Moderate violation | Lose Glamour + Willpower |
| Major violation | Banality gain, curse |
| Complete betrayal | Severe curse, possible Undoing |
