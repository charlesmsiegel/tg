# Glade Module

Create natural places where the Dreaming touches the Autumn World. Glades are the raw, undeveloped predecessors of freeholds.

## What is a Glade?

A Glade is a natural location where wellsprings of Glamour pierce the barriers between Autumn World and Dreaming. Unlike freeholds (constructed and refined), Glades are primal reflections of both realms that shift in response to environmental changes.

**Key Differences from Freeholds**:
- Natural vs constructed
- Wellspring vs Balefire (mechanically similar, different terminology)
- More responsive to environmental/Dreaming changes
- May naturally evolve between Archetypes over centuries
- Lack refined defensive capabilities

## Glade Archetypes

### Core Archetypes (C20)

| Archetype | Terrain | Association |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Aerie** | Mountain peaks, tall trees, clifftops | Sky, wind, birds, isolation |
| **Glen** | Sheltered valleys, meadows, clearings | Peace, growth, gathering |
| **Grotto** | Coastal caves, sea cliffs, tidal pools | Water, mystery, liminality |
| **Hollow** | Tree hollows, burrows, enclosed spaces | Shelter, secrets, small things |
| **Mount** | Mountains, hills, high ground | Power, endurance, perspective |
| **River** | Rivers, streams, waterfalls | Flow, change, journey |
| **Subterrane** | Caves, underground chambers, tunnels | Depth, ancient memory, hidden things |

### New Archetypes (Book of Freeholds)

| Archetype | Terrain | Association | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Barrens** | Tundra, chaparral, desert | Hidden diversity, harsh beauty, resilience | Mistaken for Glens; distinguished by remoteness, desolation, harsh climate |
| **Garden** | Green spaces in urban areas | Life amid Banality, cultivation, respite | Recent category; often mistaken for small Homesteads |
| **Mire** | Swamps, bogs, fens | Mystery, healing, nightmare creatures | Often mistaken for Grottos or Hollows |
| **Oasis** | Water sources in desert | Shelter, sustenance, precious rarity | Most known in Middle East and Africa |

## Creation Workflow

### Phase 1: Location & Archetype

1. **Physical Location** — Where does the Glade exist in Autumn World?
2. **Archetype Selection** — What terrain type dominates?
3. **Aspect** — What story/emotion defines the Glade?
4. **Environmental Factors** — Climate, accessibility, nearby human activity

### Phase 2: Backgrounds (Point-Buy)

| Background | Rating | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| **Wellspring** | 1-5 | Heart of the Glade (like Balefire) |
| **Size** | 1-5 | Physical area |
| **Sanctuary** | 1-5 | Natural defenses, accessibility, guardians |
| **Resources** | 1-5 | Chimerical only; ≤ Size or Wellspring (lesser) |
| **Passage** | 1-5 | One free rath/trod; ≤ Size |

### Size Scale

| Rating | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| 1 | Pocket garden, hill, fishpond, small cavern |
| 2 | Meadow, foothill, pond/river, moderate cavern |
| 3 | Wooded copse, series of hills, lake, large cavern, small cave system (2-3) |
| 4 | Forest, mountain, large lake/river, cave network (6-8) |
| 5 | National park, Mount Everest, Great Lakes, significant cave system (9-15) |

### Wellspring Forms

Manifests as natural object fitting Archetype:
- **Heartstone** — Stone, crystal, gem
- **Heartspring** — Geyser, fountain, pool
- **Heartwood** — Tree, root, branch
- **Heartblossom** — Flower, plant, fungi
- **Heartwind** — Dust devil, leaf swirl, breeze

**Critical**: If wellspring removed from Glade, Glamour dries up. Glade loses 1 dot/day until restored.

### Phase 3: Powers

| Power | Cost | Effect |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Glamour to Dross** | Free at Wellspring ••+ | Automatic midnight conversion |
| **Lingering Dreams** | 1/dot (1-5) | +1 die/dot to last harvester until next sleep |
| **Nature's Bounty** | 1/dot (2-5) | Multiple changelings can harvest (≤ Wellspring) |

**Note**: Normally only first to fall asleep receives Glamour. Nature's Bounty changes this.

### Phase 4: Quirks & Ecosystem

**Quirks**: Strange features springing from Dreaming. Glades are more prone to quirks than freeholds.

**Chimerical Ecosystem**: What creatures naturally inhabit the Glade? How does the local Dreaming manifest?

### Phase 5: Caretakers & Threats

**Caretakers**: Who tends the Glade? 
- Kithain guardians
- Nunnehi/Gallain (for undeveloped Glades)
- Natural chimera
- No one (wild Glade)

**Threats**: What endangers the Glade?
- Development into freehold (contentious for Nunnehi)
- Banality encroachment
- Thallain corruption
- Environmental destruction
- Dreaming creatures

## Glade vs Freehold Development

Glades can be developed into freeholds through:
1. **Claiming**: Swearing Oath of Demesne to wellspring
2. **Refinement**: Converting wellspring to balefire
3. **Construction**: Building freehold structures

**Controversy**: Nunnehi, Menehune, and other Gallain cannot use Glamour from refined freeholds. Each Glade developed is one less Medicine source for them.
