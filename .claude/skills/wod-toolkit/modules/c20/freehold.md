# Freehold Module

Create complete C20 freehold packages using the extended rules from Book of Freeholds.

## What is a Freehold?

A freehold is a location between the Dreaming and Autumn World where changelings work, socialize, hold court, take refuge from Banality, and travel into the Dreaming. Constructed atop Glades and held by freeholders. Heart of every freehold is its **balefire** (Ignis Vesta)—pure fire that burns away the mundane and purifies humanity's subconscious into raw Glamour.

---

## Creation Workflow

### Phase 1: Concept & Brainstorming

1. **Concept** — Purpose, history, owner/ruler
2. **Location** — Autumn World placement and significance
3. **Acquisition** — How the freehold was obtained:
   - **Homemade Brownies** — Built from discovered wellspring
   - **Mysterious Heirloom** — Owned in previous life
   - **Reclaimed Heritage** — Repelled previous threat/occupant
   - **Amazing Treasure** — Drawn from Dreaming via artifact
   - **Stolen Prize** — Won/taken from another changeling
   - **Regency** — Granted via Oath of Regency

### Phase 2: Archetype Selection

| Archetype | Benefit | Focus |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Academy** | -2 diff on one chosen Ability | Teaching, training |
| **Hearth** | -2 diff on Leadership OR Socialize | Social hub, refuge |
| **Homestead** | -2 diff on Survival OR Animal Ken; produces chimerical goods | Farming, animals |
| **Manor** | -2 diff on Etiquette | Noble community |
| **Market** | -2 diff on Persuasion OR Subterfuge | Trade, commerce |
| **Repository** | -2 diff on Lore | Knowledge, research |
| **Stronghold** | -2 diff on Firearms OR Melee | Military, defense |
| **Thorpe** | -2 diff on Empathy | Multi-balefire community |
| **Workshop** | -2 diff on Craft; produces chimerical goods | Manufacturing |

### Phase 3: Aspect & Appearance

**Aspect**: Underlying dream/emotion foundation. Must match location's legends/emotions. Freeholder must support Aspect through tangible acts.

**Appearance**: Both Autumn (mortal) and Dreaming (chimerical) forms. Usually match but may differ dramatically.

### Phase 4: Features (Point-Buy)

| Feature | Cost/Dot | Effect |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Balefire** | 1 | Glamour/dross production equal to rating |
| **Size** | 1 | Physical/chimerical area |
| **Sanctuary** | 1 | Defense dice; Reaving resistance; discovery difficulty |
| **Resources** | 1 | Mundane income or chimerical materials |
| **Passages** | 1/passage | One free rath/trod; additional cost 1 each |

#### Balefire Ratings
| Rating | Name | Glamour/Week |
|--------|------|--------------|
| 1 | Ember | 1 |
| 2 | Candle | 2 |
| 3 | Hearth | 3 |
| 4 | Bonfire | 4 |
| 5 | Blaze | 5+ |

#### Size Ratings
| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| 0 | Faerie ring, decorated stone (no walls) |
| 1 | Apartment; 1-2 rooms |
| 2 | Home; 3-4 rooms |
| 3 | Mansion/warehouse; 5-8 rooms |
| 4 | Estate/fortress; 9-15 rooms |
| 5 | Town/significant land; Tara-Nar |

### Phase 5: Powers (Optional)

| Power | Cost | Effect |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Warning Call** | • | Alert to intruders; roll Sanctuary vs Glamour concealment |
| **Glamour to Dross** | •• | Unclaimed Glamour converts nightly (cap: 2× balefire) |
| **Resonant Dreams** | •• | +2 dice on Aspect-related checks or one Art |
| **Call Forth the Flame** | ••• | Create Covenant of Flame component |
| **Dual Nature** | ••• | Benefit from second Archetype |
| **Cantrips** | 2×Art rating | Hold resonant cantrips |

### Phase 6: Hierarchy & Investment

**Glamour Investment**: Each freeholder invests minimum 1 Glamour dot.
- Combined investment must meet or exceed balefire rating
- Shortfall: pay difference or sacrifice Treasures (C20 p.314)

**Hierarchy Decisions**:
- How Glamour production is divided
- Which privileges are shared/exclusive
- Who controls which areas/aspects

### Phase 7: Quirks

Freehold features that spring from nightmares or ambient Dreaming—not under freeholder control. Should present adventure opportunity, not reason to abandon.

### Phase 8: ⛔ CREATE SUB-DOCUMENTS (BLOCKING)

**Guardian Chimera**: Read `modules/chimera.md` → Save to `./chimera/`

**Treasures**: Read `modules/treasure.md` → Save to `./treasures/`

**Key Inhabitants**: Read `modules/character.md` (NPC mode) → Save to `./npcs/`

**Passages**: Document trods/raths with destinations, requirements, maintenance

### Phase 9: Finalization

- Complete main document after all sub-components
- Cross-link all documents
- Calculate total feature points and verify Holdings allocation
- Validate against checklist
