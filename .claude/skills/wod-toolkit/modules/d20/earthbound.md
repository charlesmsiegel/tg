# Earthbound Module

Create ancient demons bound to reliquaries.

## Overview

The Earthbound are demons who escaped the Abyss long ago by anchoring themselves to physical objects (reliquaries) instead of mortal hosts. They are immensely powerful, deeply Tormented, and utterly alien to the newly returned fallen.

**Warning**: Earthbound are typically NPCs and antagonists. They are vastly more powerful than player characters and often serve as major threats or patrons.

## Nature of the Earthbound

### Key Differences from Fallen

| Aspect | Fallen | Earthbound |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Host** | Mortal body | Inanimate reliquary |
| **Torment** | Varies (often 3-6) | Always 7-10 |
| **Humanity** | Retains some | Almost none |
| **Power** | Limited | Vast within territory |
| **Mobility** | Free | Bound to reliquary |
| **Memory** | Fragmentary | Often extensive |
| **Goals** | Varied | Typically domination or destruction |

### Origin

Earthbound escaped the Abyss centuries or millennia ago:
- Found cracks in reality before the Maelstrom
- Could not find suitable mortal hosts
- Anchored to objects of significance
- Built cults to sustain themselves
- Grew in power but lost humanity

### Psychology

Millennia without human contact warped them:
- Alien thought patterns
- No empathy for mortals (they're fuel)
- View fallen as children or rivals
- Obsessive about territory and worship
- Often pursue incomprehensible goals

## Earthbound Statistics

### Faith

Earthbound have vastly higher Faith than fallen:
- **Minimum**: 6
- **Typical**: 8-10
- **Maximum**: Theoretically unlimited

Higher Faith grants:
- More powerful evocations
- Greater reality-warping
- Longer effective range
- More simultaneous effects

### Torment

Earthbound are always high-Torment:
- **Minimum**: 7 (by definition)
- **Typical**: 9-10
- **Effect**: All evocations manifest in corrupted form

### Lore

Earthbound typically know far more Lore:
- All House Lore at high levels
- Often multiple Houses' Lore
- May know lost or forbidden evocations
- Some have created unique powers

### Territory

Earthbound power is tied to territory:
- **Core**: Within line of sight of reliquary (full power)
- **Domain**: Area of established worship (reduced power)
- **Reach**: Anywhere cult members exist (minimal power)
- **Beyond**: Cannot act directly

## The Reliquary

### Nature

The physical anchor of an Earthbound:
- **Size**: Ranges from small object to building
- **Composition**: Often gold, stone, or ancient materials
- **Appearance**: Usually bears demon's symbols
- **Aura**: Radiates supernatural presence

### Types

| Type | Examples | Advantages |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Portable** | Idol, book, weapon | Can be moved; hidden easily |
| **Stationary** | Altar, pillar, tomb | More power; harder to destroy |
| **Architectural** | Temple, pyramid | Maximum power; very difficult to destroy |
| **Natural** | Stone formation, ancient tree | Nearly impossible to destroy |

### Protection

Reliquaries are difficult to damage:
- Immune to mundane damage
- Resistant to supernatural damage
- Often guarded by wards
- Protected by fanatical cultists
- Destruction requires specific methods

### Vulnerability

Destroying the reliquary harms the Earthbound:
- May banish demon temporarily
- May weaken permanently
- Rarely destroys completely (demon reforms)
- Usually requires ritual knowledge

---

## Earthbound Cults

### Structure

Earthbound maintain mortal cults:
- **Inner Circle**: Thralls who know the truth
- **Priests**: Powerful servants with granted abilities
- **Worshippers**: Believing followers
- **Dupes**: Those who serve unknowingly

### Purpose

Cults serve several functions:
- **Faith Source**: Worship generates Faith
- **Protection**: Guard the reliquary
- **Agency**: Act in the physical world
- **Expansion**: Recruit new worshippers

### Control Methods

| Method | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Pacts** | Formal binding with obligations |
| **Addiction** | Supernatural dependency |
| **Fear** | Terror of divine punishment |
| **Love** | Manufactured devotion |
| **Possession** | Direct control of vessels |
