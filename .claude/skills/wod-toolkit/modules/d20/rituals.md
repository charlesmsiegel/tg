# Rituals Module

Extended evocation applications requiring time and preparation.

## Overview

Rituals are extended uses of evocations that achieve greater effects through longer casting times, multiple participants, or special conditions. Unlike standard evocations (instant actions), rituals require preparation and often involve symbolic components.

## Ritual Basics

### Difference from Standard Evocations

| Aspect | Standard Evocation | Ritual |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| **Time** | One action | Minutes to hours |
| **Preparation** | None | Often required |
| **Participants** | Single demon | Can be group |
| **Effect** | Immediate, limited | Delayed, enhanced |
| **Faith Cost** | 0-1 typically | 1-5 or more |

### When to Use Rituals

Rituals are appropriate when:
- Standard evocation effect is insufficient
- Extended duration is needed
- Multiple targets must be affected
- Permanent or lasting change is desired
- Group coordination enhances power

---

## Ritual Mechanics

### Casting Time

| Complexity | Time | Example |
|------------|------|---------|
| Simple | 10 minutes | Enhanced sensing, minor ward |
| Standard | 1 hour | Blessing, curse, moderate ward |
| Complex | Several hours | Major transformation, binding |
| Grand | Full day or more | Permanent effects, mass influence |

### Extended Rolls

Rituals use extended rolls instead of simple rolls:
- **Roll**: Attribute + Ability (as normal for the evocation)
- **Interval**: Time between rolls (minutes to hours)
- **Target Successes**: Total needed for completion
- **Failure**: May abort ritual or cause complications

### Ritual Components

Many rituals benefit from or require components:

| Component Type | Effect |
|----------------|--------|
| **Symbolic objects** | -1 difficulty |
| **Sacred space** | -1 difficulty |
| **Appropriate timing** | -1 difficulty (dawn, full moon, etc.) |
| **Multiple participants** | Additional dice |
| **Sacrifice** | Bonus successes or reduced difficulty |
| **True Name** | Dramatically enhanced effects on target |

---

## Group Rituals

### Combining Power

Multiple demons can participate in rituals:
- **Leader**: Primary caster; rolls normally
- **Assistants**: Each adds 1-2 dice to leader's pool
- **Requirement**: All must know the base evocation at 1+ dots
- **Maximum**: Typically Faith of leader = max assistants

### Ritual Roles

| Role | Contribution |
|------|--------------|
| **Primary** | Makes rolls; directs ritual |
| **Secondary** | Adds dice; can take over if primary fails |
| **Support** | Adds single die; maintains components |
| **Sacrifice** | Provides Faith directly (risky) |

### Failure in Group Rituals

If ritual fails:
- All participants may suffer backlash
- Faith spent is lost
- Components may be destroyed
- Torment checks may be required

---

## Ritual Sacrifice

### Types of Sacrifice

| Sacrifice | Faith Generated | Moral Cost |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Symbolic** | None (reduces difficulty) | None |
| **Material** | 1 | None |
| **Blood** | 1-2 | Minor (Torment check at diff 6) |
| **Life (animal)** | 2-3 | Moderate (Torment check at diff 7) |
| **Life (human)** | 3-5 | Severe (Torment check at diff 8) |
| **Soul** | 5+ | Extreme (automatic Torment gain) |

### Using Sacrifice

Sacrifice can:
- Provide bonus successes
- Reduce difficulty
- Extend duration
- Enhance effect magnitude

---

## Creating Custom Rituals

### Step 1: Base Evocation

Identify which evocation the ritual extends:
- Must know the evocation
- Ritual effect must relate to evocation's domain

### Step 2: Desired Effect

Define what the ritual accomplishes:
- Target (who/what is affected)
- Effect (what happens)
- Duration (how long it lasts)
- Range (how far it reaches)

### Step 3: Determine Parameters

Set ritual requirements:
- Casting time (based on complexity)
- Target successes (based on power)
- Faith cost (based on magnitude)
- Components (based on effect type)

### Step 4: Identify Risks

What can go wrong:
- Failure consequences
- Torment implications
- Detection risk
- Backlash possibilities
