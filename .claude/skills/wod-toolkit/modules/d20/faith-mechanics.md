# Faith Mechanics Module

Comprehensive guide to Faith—the demon's primary power resource.

## Overview

Faith is the fundamental resource that powers all demonic abilities. Unlike vampiric blood (renewable through feeding) or mage Quintessence (ambient and personal), Faith comes almost exclusively from mortals—their belief, worship, and devotion.

---

## Faith Basics

### What Faith Represents

Faith is crystallized belief and spiritual energy:
- Mortal conviction made tangible
- The power of worship and devotion
- Connection to the divine spark in humanity
- The substance that once powered Heaven

### Faith Rating vs Faith Pool

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Faith Rating** | Maximum Faith capacity (1-10) |
| **Faith Pool** | Current available Faith points |

A demon with Faith 6 can hold up to 6 points of Faith at once.

---

## Using Faith

### Evocations

Most evocations can be powered by Faith:
- **Spend 1 Faith**: Add automatic success to evocation roll
- **Multiple Faith**: Each point adds one success
- **Maximum**: Cannot exceed Faith Rating in single evocation

### Apocalyptic Form

Revealing true form costs Faith:
- **Activation**: 1 Faith to reveal apocalyptic form
- **Duration**: Lasts for scene
- **Dismissal**: Free action, no cost

### Innate Abilities

Demons have several Faith-powered innate abilities:

| Ability | Faith Cost | Effect |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Healing | 1 per level | Heal one health level (even aggravated) |
| Resist Damage | 1 | Downgrade one aggravated to lethal |
| Boost Roll | 1 | Add automatic success to any roll |
| Sense Supernatural | 0 (passive) | Detect other supernaturals nearby |

### Empowering Thralls

Demons can invest Faith in thralls:
- **Investment**: Faith committed to thrall
- **Effect**: Grants thrall supernatural abilities
- **Recovery**: Returns only when thrall dies or pact ends
- **Risk**: Invested Faith unavailable for demon's use

## Gaining Faith

### Sources of Faith

| Source | Faith Gained | Frequency |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **Worship** | 1 | Per week of regular worship |
| **Pact** | 1-3 | Per month per pact |
| **Sacrifice** | 1-5 | Per sacrifice (see below) |
| **Reaping** | 1-3 | Per reaping (dangerous) |
| **Inspiration** | 1 | Per significant inspired mortal |
| **True Faith encounter** | Variable | Rare and dangerous |

### Worship

Regular devotion from believers:
- Thralls provide most reliable worship
- Requires genuine belief (not just going through motions)
- Faith accumulates over time
- Maximum per worshipper: 1 per week

**Worship Quality Modifiers**:
| Quality | Faith Modifier |
|---------|----------------|
| Rote/routine | ×0.5 |
| Sincere | ×1 |
| Fervent | ×1.5 |
| Ecstatic | ×2 |

### Pacts

Formal agreements generate steady Faith:
- Soul pacts: 2-3 Faith/month
- Service pacts: 1-2 Faith/month
- Worship pacts: 1 Faith/month
- Exchange pacts: One-time payment

### Sacrifice

Offerings to the demon:
| Sacrifice Type | Faith Value |
|----------------|-------------|
| Valuables | 1 |
| Blood (non-fatal) | 1-2 |
| Animal life | 2-3 |
| Human life | 3-5 |
| Willing soul | 5+ |

**Torment Warning**: Accepting lethal sacrifices typically requires Torment checks.

### Reaping

Forcibly extracting Faith from mortals:
- **Method**: Touch and force of will
- **Roll**: Manipulation + Intimidation vs. Willpower
- **Faith Gained**: Successes (max 3)
- **Effect on Mortal**: Trauma, weakness, depression
- **Risk**: Torment check (difficulty 7)

Reaping is considered violation and corrupts both parties.

### Inspiration

Faith from mortals the demon has genuinely helped:
- Must be sincere assistance (not manipulation)
- Mortal must attribute improvement to demon
- Provides 1 Faith when mortal achieves goal
- No Torment cost; actually reduces Torment

---

## Faith and Torment Interaction

### High Torment Effects

When Torment exceeds Faith:
- Evocations manifest in corrupted form
- More difficult to gain Faith through worship
- Easier to gain Faith through reaping and sacrifice
- Mortals sense wrongness; harder to inspire

### The Torment/Faith Balance

| Torment vs Faith | Effect |
|------------------|--------|
| Torment < Faith | Low-Torment evocations; positive interactions |
| Torment = Faith | Balanced; either version possible |
| Torment > Faith | High-Torment evocations; corruption |
| Torment ≥ 7 | High-Torment apocalyptic form mandatory |

---

## Managing Thralls for Faith

### Optimal Thrall Network

For sustainable Faith income:
| Thrall Type | Faith/Month | Investment |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Casual worshipper | 0.5 | Minimal |
| Devoted follower | 1 | Moderate |
| Bound thrall | 1-2 | Pact + attention |
| Cult priest | 2-3 | Significant |
| High priest | 3-4 | Major investment |

### Thrall Maintenance

Thralls require attention:
- Occasional miracles or blessings
- Protection from enemies
- Guidance and attention
- Fulfillment of pact promises

Neglected thralls:
- Faith output decreases
- May seek to break pact
- May betray demon to enemies
- May die (Faith investment lost)

---

## Faith Economy

### Starting Faith

New demons begin with Faith 3:
- Sufficient for basic evocations
- Enough for occasional apocalyptic form
- Need to build Faith sources quickly

### Faith Expenditure Planning

Typical session Faith budget:
| Activity | Faith Cost |
|----------|------------|
| One apocalyptic form reveal | 1 |
| Boosting 3-4 evocations | 3-4 |
| Emergency healing | 2-3 |
| Empowering thrall | Varies |
| **Typical Session Total** | **5-8** |

### Faith Scarcity

When Faith runs low:
- Avoid apocalyptic form except emergencies
- Don't boost evocations
- Focus on Faith acquisition
- Consider desperate measures (reaping, sacrifice)

---

## Faith and Other Supernaturals

### Vampires

- Vampires have no Faith; cannot provide it
- Demon blood has no special properties
- Ghouls can provide Faith (they're still mortal)

### Werewolves

- Garou have strong spiritual connection
- Can sense demons (may attack)
- Their Gnosis is incompatible with Faith
- Kinfolk can provide Faith normally

### Mages

- Awakened mortals provide turbulent Faith
- Paradox interferes with Faith generation
- Sleepers (unawakened) provide Faith normally
- Technocrats' disbelief may actually block Faith

### Wraiths

- Ghosts cannot provide Faith (not alive)
- Can be affected by Faith-powered evocations
- Rising (ghosts in bodies) might provide minimal Faith

### Changelings

- Fae provide corrupted/wild Faith
- Banality in mortals blocks Faith generation
- Glamour and Faith interact unpredictably
- Enchanted mortals provide enhanced Faith temporarily

---

## Increasing Faith Rating

Faith Rating can be increased through:

### Experience Points

Standard advancement:
- Cost: Current Rating × 7 XP
- Example: Faith 5 → 6 costs 35 XP

### Story Events

Significant accomplishments may grant Faith increases:
- Gaining powerful thrall network
- Achieving major Faction goal
- Recovering pre-Fall memories
- Reconnecting with divine purpose

### Torment Reduction

Consistently low Torment can enable Faith growth:
- Sustained Torment below 3
- Acts of genuine redemption
- May trigger Faith increase as reward
