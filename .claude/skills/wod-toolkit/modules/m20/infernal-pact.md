# Infernal Pact Module

Rules for creating and tracking infernal pacts between characters and demonic entities. These apply to ANY character—not just Nephandi.

## Important Context

**True Nephandi rarely make pacts.** The quest for personal power is intrinsic to their Path, and begging favors from a more powerful entity in exchange for servitude is weakness. "Eaters of the Weak" don't become the eaten.

**Who DOES make pacts:**
- Nephandic pawns and allies (cultists, etc.)
- Desperate mages seeking power they can't earn
- Sorcerers who want capabilities beyond their Paths
- Goetic practitioners seeking specific knowledge (this is acceptable even for Nephandi)
- Mortals who stumble into dark bargains

**Exception:** Conjuring demons for knowledge (not servitude) is fine for Nephandi. Summoning Asmodeus to ask math questions, then releasing him with a small payment, demonstrates power—not weakness.

## The Foederis Infernus (Infernal Pact)

### How Pacts Work

1. **Summoning:** The mortal calls upon a demonic entity
2. **Negotiation:** Terms are discussed (services for favors)
3. **Investment:** The demon literally "invests" power in the mortal
4. **Service:** The mortal performs increasingly depraved acts
5. **Escalation:** More power demands more evil
6. **Culmination:** Eventually, the soul is fully owned

**Note:** Soul-selling usually comes LAST, not first. Starting with "I'll give you my soul" is terrible negotiation.

## Pact Levels

Each level confers freebie points equal to its rating. Points can be spent on Backgrounds, Advantages, or other Traits—but **NEVER on Arete or Spheres** (those require internal Enlightenment).

### Level 1: Malice
**Requirement:** Minor sins—theft, slander, assault, petty cruelty
**Freebie Points:** 1

### Level 2: Cruelty
**Requirement:** Mortal torment, serious injury, possibly murder
**Freebie Points:** 2

### Level 3: Immorality
**Requirement:** Extreme cruelty, aberrant lusts, painful sacrifice of living things
**Freebie Points:** 3

### Level 4: Wrongdoing
**Requirement:** Active force for large-scale malignancy—affecting many people
**Freebie Points:** 4

### Level 5: Corruption
**Requirement:** Lead others into whirlpools of sin, corrupt innocents
**Freebie Points:** 5

### Level 6: Mortal Sin
**Requirement:** Cult leadership, undermining righteous organizations, grand corruption
**Freebie Points:** 6

### Level 7: Heresy
**Requirement:** Constant pursuit of evil, depraved sins, usually behind a façade of righteousness
**Freebie Points:** 7

### Level 8: Damnable Acts
**Requirement:** Escalating atrocities, point of no moral return
**Freebie Points:** 8

### Level 9: Soul Selling
**Requirement:** Partial soul binding—the demon has a claim
**Freebie Points:** 9

### Level 10: Full Damnation
**Requirement:** Complete soul ownership—upon death, the soul belongs to the Patronus
**Freebie Points:** 10

**Cumulative:** Pacts can be made repeatedly up to Level 9. Each new pact digs the grave deeper.

## Demonic Investment Flaws

The Patronus doesn't give without taking.

### Service
**Effect:** The demon demands regular service—tasks, sacrifices, corruption
**Frequency:** Increases with pact level
**Failure:** Punishment ranges from pain to power withdrawal to direct attack

### Moth into Flame
**Effect:** The pawn finds themselves escalating—each act must be worse than the last to feel the same satisfaction
**Mechanics:** Willpower rolls to resist escalation, increasing difficulty

### Marked
**Effect:** Those with supernatural senses can see the demon's mark
**Detection:** Aura perception, Spirit Sight, etc.

### Summoned
**Effect:** The Patronus can summon the pawn at will
**Consequences:** Drop everything and attend, or face punishment

- Level 3: Sought forbidden knowledge, sacrificed his cat

### Current Status
Buer wants him to arrange an "accident" for a local mage. Marcus is trying to find a way out but knows there isn't one.

## Goetic Knowledge Pacts

For mages (including Nephandi) who summon demons purely for knowledge:

**This is different from servitude.**

1. Conjure demon through Goetia/Demonism
2. Offer fair trade (minor service, sacrifice, information)
3. Receive teaching (often Knowledge dots)
4. Release demon with agreed payment

**Pact Level:** Usually 1-2 (minor favors, not soul-binding)
**Acceptable for Nephandi:** Yes—commanding demons demonstrates power
