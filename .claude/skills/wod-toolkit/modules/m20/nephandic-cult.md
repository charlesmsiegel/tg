# Nephandic Cult Module

Create Nephandic-influenced mortal organizations, cults, and front companies. Includes mortal pawn archetypes.

## Organization Types

### Cult (Religious/Spiritual)

### Social Network
Informal group connected by shared interests that have been corrupted. Festival crews, online communities, hobby groups.

### Infiltrated Institution
