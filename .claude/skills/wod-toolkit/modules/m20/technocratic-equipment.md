# Technocratic Equipment Module

Create Technocratic Union equipment (apparatus) for M20.

## When to Use

Use this module instead of `wonder.md` when creating:
- Any Technocratic device, gadget, or tool
- Equipment powered by Enlightened Science
- Apparatus for Technocratic characters

## Equipment Categories

The Technocracy uses **seven distinct categories** of equipment:

| Category | Reusability | Users | Enlightenment Req |
|----------|-------------|-------|-------------------|
| **Gadget** | Single-use | Anyone trained | No |
| **Trinket** | Reusable, simple | T1+ Operatives | No |

| **Invention** | Unique creation | Creator + trained | Usually |
| **Primer** | Consumable ammo | Anyone | No |
| **Matrix** | Power source | Enlightened | Usually |

## Equipment Statistics

Unlike mystic Wonders, Technocratic equipment uses:

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Enlightenment** | Required rating to create/use (not Arete) |
| **Primal Energy** | Power capacity |
| **Background Cost** | Points to acquire |
| **Category** | Gadget/Trinket/Device/etc. |

### Inventions (Unique Creations)

One-of-a-kind devices created by individual Technocrats.

| Trait | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Reusability | Varies |
| Users | Creator + trained operators |
| Complexity | Varies |
| Cost | Varies |

These follow rules similar to mystic Wonders but with Technocratic paradigm.

### Primers (Consumables)

Ammunition, fuel, and expendable supplies.

| Trait | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Reusability | Consumed on use |
| Users | Anyone with appropriate weapon |
| Complexity | Low |
| Cost | 1-3 Background pts per batch |

**Examples:**
- Energy weapon cells
- SPECM cartridges
- Specialized ammunition

### Matrices (Power Sources)

Containers and sources of Primal Energy.

| Trait | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Reusability | Rechargeable |
| Users | Enlightened |
| Complexity | Medium-High |
| Cost | 3-10 Background pts |

**Examples:**
- SPECM (Stored Prime Energy Conduit Matrix)
- Portable reactors
- Tass containers (yes, Technocrats use Tass)

## ES-Phone and Apps

The ES-Phone is the standard Technocratic smartphone with modular capabilities.

### Base ES-Phone
**Enlightenment:** 3-6 | **Primal Energy:** 15-30 | **Background Cost:** 6+

**Base Features:**
- Secure communication (Data 3/Entropy 2/Mind 1)
- Digital Web access (Data 2)
- VR band compatibility

### Available Apps (Additional Cost)

| App | Cost | Effect |
|-----|------|--------|
