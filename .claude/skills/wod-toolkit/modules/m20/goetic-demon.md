# Goetic Demon Module

Statblocks and details for major demons, memetic entities, and Nephandic Paradox manifestations.

## Using This Module

These entities are typically:
- **Summoned** through Goetia, Demonism, or Spirit magick
- **Encountered** as manifestations or Paradox effects
- **Referenced** as patrons for Infernalists or pact-makers

Most are too powerful for direct combat—they're forces of nature, not opponents to fight.

## Memetic Entities

Beings that exist as ideas, concepts, or emergent phenomena.

```
This entity has no fixed stats—it's a concept given form.
Power scales with belief and attention.

### Zagglaaw (He Comes)

**Domain:** Harbinger, herald of Those Who Dwell Behind the Stars

**Nature:** Not the horror itself—the warning of the horror's approach

**Personality:** None. It's a signal, not a being.

**Appearance:** Patterns in static. Shapes in clouds. The feeling of something vast noticing you.

**Statblock:**
```
Zagglaaw doesn't have stats. It's a phenomenon.

Signs of presence:
- Strange patterns appearing everywhere
