## Doctrine of Mutuality Status

The Technocracy's Doctrine of Mutuality (DOM) defines "personhood":

| Category | DOM Status | Treatment |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Enhanced Humans | Full person | Equal rights |
| Clones (high-quality) | Full person | Equal rights |
| Uplifts | Person (debated) | Generally equal |
| MIOs | Person | Equal rights |
| Androids | Second-class | Tool status |
| HIT Marks | Second-class | Weapon status |
| Robots (non-humanoid) | Not a person | Property |
| Aliens | Not applicable | Case-by-case |

### Adamite Prejudice

Some Technocrats (the "Adamite" faction) harbor prejudice against enhanced beings. This is officially unmutual but persists informally.
