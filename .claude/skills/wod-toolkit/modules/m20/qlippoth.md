# Qlippoth Module

The Qlippothic Tree of Knowledge tracks Nephandic spiritual advancement—their "Descent" rather than Ascension. This is unique to Fallen mages.

## Overview

The Qlippoth ("shells" or "husks") are the Nightside of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. Where Ascension mages climb toward unity with the Divine, Nephandi descend through broken vessels toward the Void Absolute.

**Key Concept:** Nephandi don't merely DO evil—they have been fundamentally TRANSFORMED by passing through the Qlippoth. This soul-deep change is what makes them Nephandi rather than merely bad people.

## The Tree of Knowledge

Descent proceeds from 10 (outermost) toward 1 (innermost), with Daath as the crossing point.

### Stage 10: Lilith (Queen of Night)
**Theme:** Initiation, seduction, the first step into darkness

**Challenges:** Accepting the call to Descent, abandoning old allegiances, first acts of betrayal

**Rulers:** Lilith and her daughters—seducers and tempters

**What It Means:** The mage has heard the call of the Void and taken the first steps. They may not have passed the Caul yet, but they've begun the journey.

---

### Stage 9: Gamaliel (The Obscene Ones)
**Theme:** Dark sexuality, transgression, perversion of desire

**Challenges:** Using desire as a weapon, exploiting intimacy, corrupting love

**Rulers:** Entities of corrupt passion

**What It Means:** The mage has learned to weaponize desire and intimacy. Sex, love, and connection become tools of corruption.

---

### Stage 8: Samael (Poison of God)
**Theme:** Deception, venom, the poisoning of truth

**Challenges:** Mastering lies, spreading corruption through words, destroying trust

**Rulers:** Samael, the Poison of God—deceiver and accuser

**What It Means:** The mage has become a master of deception. Truth itself becomes a weapon to twist.

---

### Stage 7: A'arab Zaraq (Ravens of Dispersion)
**Theme:** War, destruction, scattering what was whole

**Challenges:** Causing conflict, breaking communities, destroying bonds

**Rulers:** The Ravens—spirits of war and dissolution

**What It Means:** The mage has learned to destroy not just individuals but communities, organizations, and relationships.

---

### Stage 6: Thagirion (The Disputers)
**Theme:** The Black Sun, pride, judgment of the weak

**Challenges:** Confronting one's own pride, judging others worthy of destruction, embracing superiority

**Rulers:** Entities of the Black Sun—harsh light that reveals and condemns

**What It Means:** The mage has embraced their superiority over the "weak." This is often where the Lex Praedatorius becomes fully internalized.

---

### Stage 5: Golchab (The Flaming Ones)
**Theme:** Wrath, burning, consuming fire

**Challenges:** Unleashing destruction without restraint, burning away hesitation

**Rulers:** Entities of divine wrath turned against creation

**What It Means:** The mage has let go of restraint. Destruction becomes beautiful.

---

### Stage 4: Gha'ag Sheblah (The Smiter)
**Theme:** Violence, cruelty, direct harm

**Challenges:** Inflicting suffering personally, becoming comfortable with cruelty

**Rulers:** The Smiter—embodiment of deliberate harm

**What It Means:** The mage has become personally comfortable with violence and cruelty. This isn't abstract evil—it's hands-on.

---

### Daath (The Returned Abyss)
**Theme:** The Abyss, the Caul, transformation

**This is not a Qlipha but the CROSSING POINT.**

**The Caul:** Passing through Daath means going through the Caul—the moment of true transformation where the mage's Avatar is inverted. This is the point of no return.

**Before Daath:** The mage is falling, but might theoretically be saved.
**After Daath:** The mage IS a Nephandus. Their Avatar has been transformed.

---

### Stage 3: Satariel (The Concealers)
**Theme:** Hidden knowledge, secrets that should not be known

**Challenges:** Pursuing knowledge that destroys the knower, learning truths that unmake sanity

**Rulers:** Entities who hide God's face—keepers of forbidden knowledge

**What It Means:** The mage has passed beyond the Caul and now pursues knowledge that was hidden for good reason. Very powerful Nephandi.

---

### Stage 2: Ghagiel (The Hinderers)
**Theme:** Chaos, opposition to creation, pure obstruction

**Challenges:** Becoming an obstacle to all creation, opposing existence itself

**Rulers:** The Hinderers—those who oppose the act of creation

**What It Means:** The mage has become a fundamental obstacle to existence. They don't just destroy—they prevent.

---

### Stage 1: Thaumiel (The Twin Gods)
**Theme:** Duality, the threshold of godhood, two-headed power

**Challenges:** Approaching divine power while remaining divided

**Rulers:** The Twin Gods—Satan in his aspect of divided godhood

**What It Means:** The mage stands at the threshold of becoming something more than mortal. Extremely rare and terrifying.

---

### Stage 0: The Black Diamond (Universe B)
**Theme:** Transcendence through annihilation, becoming a new absolute

**This is the theoretical END of the Descent—becoming one of Those Who Dwell Behind the Stars.**

No mortal mage has definitively achieved this. It may be impossible. It may be the ultimate lie the Nephandi tell themselves.

---

## Supplicii (Nephandic Seekings)

When Nephandi advance in Arete, they undergo Supplicii rather than Seekings.

### Voluntary Supplicium

The mage deliberately triggers the journey:
- Hallucinogenic drugs
- Fiendish self-torture
- Sexual magick
- Demon invocations
- Punishing ordeals
- Sacrifice (including body parts)
- Paradoxically, acts of extreme kindness (to shatter complacency)

**Process:**
1. Invoke the Qlipha to be explored
2. Descend through Nightside dreamscape
3. Meet Avatar (in its Nephandic form)
4. Enter tunnels leading to the Qlipha
5. Face challenges appropriate to that Qlipha
6. Succeed or fail

### Involuntary Supplicium

Triggered without the mage's control by:
- Extreme failure
- Demonic displeasure
- Defeat by "godly" agents
- Crisis of confidence
- Realization of what awaits at the end
- Crushing Paradox backlash
- Severe Quiet

**Difference:** The mage is stripped of resources and power—naked like Inanna at the gates of the Underworld.

### Supplicium Outcomes

**Success:**
- Gain Arete
- Possibly descend to next Qlipha (Storyteller discretion)

**Failure:**
- Survive with lasting cost: Scars, Flaws, Quiet, new enemies
- OR: Don't survive. The Qlippoth devour those who fail.

## Arete and Qlippothic Stage

**Important:** These do NOT map 1:1.

A mage might:
- Have Arete 5 but be stuck at Thagirion (Stage 6)
- Have low Arete but have descended further through non-magical transformation
- Reach Arete 10 but never pass Daath (theoretical—probably unstable)

Qlippothic stage represents SPIRITUAL transformation, not just magical power.

---

## Tracking Qlippothic Status

For Fallen characters, note:

```markdown
**Qlippothic Status:**
- Current Stage: [Qlipha name and number]
- Passed Daath: [Yes/No]
- Notable Supplicii: [Any significant experiences]
```

### Pre-Caul Status

Some characters are on the path but haven't passed through Daath:
- Barabbi who are turning but not yet transformed
- Widderslainte who haven't fully embraced their nature
- Mark as "Pre-Caul: [Current Stage]"

---

## Qlippothic Radiance (Flaw)

Mages who have traveled deep into the Qlippoth may manifest Qlippothic Radiance:

| Points | Stage Required | Effect |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | Any post-Caul | Faint darkness in aura (aura sight only) |
| 2 | Gha'ag Sheblah+ | Heavier veins of darkness, minor unease |
| 3 | Satariel+ | Pulsating anti-light, distinct queasiness |
| 4 | Ghagiel+ | Strobing anti-light, urge to flee, buzzing sounds |
| 5 | Thaumiel | Storms of anti-light, insect swarms, cowering |
