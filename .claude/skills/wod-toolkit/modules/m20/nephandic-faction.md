# Nephandic Faction Module

Details the 8 Nephandic factions from Book of the Fallen. These are NOT equivalents to Traditions/Technocracy—they are specifically Fallen organizations that Nephandi may (or may not) belong to.

## Important Notes

- Many Nephandi operate independently or in small cabals without formal faction ties
- Faction membership is optional—specify "Independent" or "Unaffiliated" if none
- Factions have loose organization; Nephandi are notoriously uncooperative
- A Nephandus may have contacts in multiple factions
