# Mockery Breeds Module

Creates Mockery Breeds - Pentex's artificial shapeshifters from Project Lycaon. These are not true Fera but engineered monsters designed to hunt and kill the Changing Breeds.

## Project Lycaon Overview

Pentex's bioengineering division created these creatures through:
- Genetic manipulation of humans and animals
- Forced Bane possession
- Stolen Fera DNA samples
- Wyrm-tainted mutagenic compounds

All Mockery Breeds are sterile (except through specific methods noted) and exist solely to serve Pentex's agenda.

## The Five Mockery Breeds

### War Wolves (Savage Hunters)
Pentex's primary anti-Garou weapon. Genetically altered humans merged with wolf DNA.

**Forms**: Lupus and Crinos only (no Homid, Glabro, or Hispo)
**Rage**: 7 | **Gnosis**: 2 | **Willpower**: 5
**Primary Mission**: Hunt and kill Garou Kinfolk to weaken bloodlines

**Traits**:
- Cannot regenerate (heal as humans)
- Immune to silver (not Garou, not vulnerable)
- Limited intelligence in Crinos (bestial)
- Pack hunters, deployed in groups of 6-12

**Creation Cost**: Extremely resource-intensive; each War Wolf represents massive Pentex investment

## Storyteller Notes

### Using Mockery Breeds

**War Wolves**: Best as terrifying pack hunters. Kinfolk NPCs should fear them.
**Anurana**: Environmental horror in polluted areas. Can be sympathetic (escaped, didn't ask for this).
**Samsa**: Urban paranoia, body horror, "what's hiding in the walls."
**Kerasi**: African chronicle muscle, environmental tragedy (rhinos corrupted).
**Yeren**: Long-term infiltration plots, corporate horror, "the mole in the sept."

### Detection
All Mockery Breeds register as Wyrm-tainted to appropriate Gifts. Yeren can mask this temporarily with Blending.

### Redemption
Generally impossible - they're engineered to serve the Wyrm. Anurana occasionally break free but remain Wyrm-tainted.
