## Pack Creation Steps

### Step Zero: Define Links
Identify the pack's weakest and strongest members by Renown. This shapes pack dynamics.

### Step One: Concept
| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Theme | What unites this pack? (ideology, mission, history) |
| Name | Pack name and any nicknames |
| Territory | Where they operate |
| Reputation | How others see them |

### Step Two: Collective Attributes
Consider the pack's overall profile:
- **Physical-heavy**: Combat pack, enforcers
- **Social-heavy**: Diplomats, infiltrators
- **Mental-heavy**: Researchers, planners

### Step Three: Overlapping Abilities
Identify 3-5 Abilities most pack members share. These become candidates for Pack Tactics.

### Step Four: Advantages
| Element | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| Totem | Required. See `modules/totem.md` |
| Shared Resources | Pooled Backgrounds (vehicles, safehouses) |
| Contacts Network | Combined Contacts/Allies |

### Step Five: Finishing Touches
- Pack positions (see below)
- Internal conflicts/bonds
- Relationship to sept
- Story hooks

## Pack Positions

### Zedakh (Alpha)
The pack leader. May be chosen by:
- Challenge (traditional)
- Consensus (modern)
- Circumstance (whoever survives)

**By Auspice:**
| Auspice | Leadership Style |
|---------|------------------|
| Ragabash | Plans contingencies, assigns by weakness analysis |
| Theurge | Holistic answers, spiritual considerations first |
| Philodox | Balance-seeking, deliberative, communicates reasoning |
| Galliard | Dramatic, story-focused, boldest risks for glory |
| Ahroun | Efficient, martial, strike hard at optimal moment |

### Taldakh (Omega)
The lowest-ranking member. May be:
- **Healthy**: New member earning place, or voluntary peacekeeper
- **Toxic**: Scapegoat, abuse victim (see "Keeping Him Down" tactic)

### Beta
Second-in-command. Often the zedakh's closest advisor or strongest challenger.

### Specialist Roles
| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| Scout | Reconnaissance, pathfinding |
| Healer | Mother's Touch provider, medical support |
| Ritualist | Primary ritemaster |
| Den Watcher | Guards territory/cubs |

## Pack Tactics System

Pack Tactics represent coordinated group actions where each member contributes their specialty.

### Structure

Each tactic has:
- **4-6 Contributing Abilities** from different members
- **One Anchor Ability** (must succeed for tactic to work)
- **Optional Multiplied Abilities** (multiple members use same Ability)

### Creation Rules

1. **Define the Tactic's Goal** — What does the pack accomplish together?
2. **Assign Abilities** — Each contributing member rolls one relevant Ability
3. **Designate Anchor** — One Ability is critical; if it fails, tactic fails
4. **Set Difficulty** — Base 6, modified by circumstances
5. **Combine Successes** — Total successes determine overall effect

### Modifiers

| Situation | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| One member "playing the game" (not contributing) | +1 difficulty to all rolls |
| Missing key role | +1 to +2 difficulty |
| Perfect coordination (all 5+ successes) | Bonus effect at ST discretion |
| Botch on anchor | Catastrophic failure |

## Pack Types

### By Composition

| Type | Description |

| **Balanced Pack** | Two tribes roughly equal |
| **Rainbow Pack** | Each member different tribe |

## Pack Dynamics

### Healthy Dynamics
- Clear hierarchy respected by all
- Members support each other's growth
- Conflicts resolved through challenge or discussion
- Totem bond strengthens all

### Toxic Dynamics
- **Enablers and Abusers**: See "Keeping Him Down" tactic
- **Stagnant Hierarchy**: No growth or challenge allowed
- **Totem Neglect**: Ignoring patron's wishes
- **Renown Hoarding**: Leaders claim all glory

---

## Totem Integration

The pack totem defines collective identity. See `modules/totem.md` for creation.

### Totem Bond Mechanics
- All pack members share totem benefits
- Totem spirit can communicate with any member
- Ban applies to entire pack
- Violating Ban risks totem abandonment

### Changing Totems

| Method | Rite | Effect |
|--------|------|--------|
| **Renunciation** | Voluntary | Pack collectively releases totem |
| **Excoriation** | Forced (Level 4) | Strips bond; points held in trust |
| **New Blood** | When member joins | Existing points redistributed |
| **Old Blood** | When member leaves/dies | Points may be lost |
