# Umbral Realm Module

Creates and details Umbral locations—from Penumbral sites to Near Realms and beyond.

## Umbral Structure

```
Physical World
     │
  Gauntlet
     │
  Penumbra (spirit reflection of Earth)
     │
  Near Umbra (13 Near Realms orbit here)
     │
  Membrane
     ├── Astral Umbra (realm of thought)
     ├── Dark Umbra (realm of the dead)
     └── Deep Umbra (cosmic void, Celestines)
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Layer

| Layer | Nature | Access Difficulty |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Penumbra | Earth's reflection | Step Sideways |
| Near Realm | Themed spirit worlds | Moon Paths, Airts |
| Tribal Homeland | Ancestral spirit territory | Tribal knowledge |
| Astral Umbra | Thought/concept realm | Meditation, special rites |
| Dark Umbra | Land of the dead | Death-related paths |
| Deep Umbra | Cosmic expanse | Anchorheads, great journeys |

### Step 2: Identify Triatic Influence

| Aspect | Visual Markers | Feel |
|--------|----------------|------|
| Wyld | Vibrant, chaotic, ever-changing | Exhilarating, dangerous |
| Weaver | Ordered, geometric, static | Oppressive, predictable |
| Wyrm | Corrupted, decaying, toxic | Nauseating, hostile |
| Gaia | Pure, vital, harmonious | Welcoming, sacred |
| Mixed | Contested territory | Unstable, conflicted |

### Step 3: Define Key Features

**For Penumbral Locations:**
- Gauntlet rating (3-9)
- Reflection accuracy (how closely it mirrors physical)
- Dominant spirits
- Notable phenomena (Blights, Glens, etc.)

**For Near Realms:**
- Entry/exit methods
- Native inhabitants
- Hazards and resources
- Sub-regions

**Consult:** `lookup.py umbra.near-realms near-realms`
