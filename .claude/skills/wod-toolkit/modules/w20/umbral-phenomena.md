# Umbral Phenomena Module

Creates Penumbral locations with special characteristics—Blights, Chimares, Epiphs, Glens, Wyldings, and other genius loci.

## Overview

The Penumbra isn't uniform. Certain areas develop distinct personalities based on their physical counterparts' resonance, history, or spiritual significance. These phenomena make the spirit world dynamic and provide rich story opportunities.

## Phenomena Types

| Type | Aspect | Nature |
|------|--------|--------|
| Blight | Wyrm/Weaver | Urban corruption hotspot |
| Chimare | Mixed | Metaphor becomes reality |
| Epiph | Conceptual | Embodied idea/phenomenon |
| Glen | Wyld/Gaia | Place of purity and peace |
| Wylding | Wyld | Zone of primal chaos |
| Genius Loci | Varies | Strong resonance location |

## Blights

Hotbeds of Wyrm/Weaver struggle in urban areas. Truth made visible.

### Characteristics
- Naked honesty about urban decay
- Wyrm and Weaver spirits contest openly

| Physical Anchor | What real-world location spawned this? |
| Dominant Force | Wyrm-leaning or Weaver-leaning? |
