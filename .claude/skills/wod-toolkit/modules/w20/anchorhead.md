# Anchorhead Module

Creates Anchorheads—crossing points through the Membrane to other Umbrae (Astral, Dark, Deep).

## Overview

The Membrane separates the Middle Umbra (where Garou naturally travel) from the Astral Umbra (realm of thought), Dark Umbra (realm of the dead), and Deep Umbra (cosmic expanse). Anchorheads are the rare passages through this barrier.

## The Three Other Umbrae

### Astral Umbra
- Realm of thought, concept, and principle
- Ideas take physical form
- Mages travel here naturally
- Garou find it disorienting

**Denizens:**
- Conceptual spirits
- Mages (common)
- Nightmares
- Vampires (rarely)

### Dark Umbra (Shadowlands)
- Realm of the dead
- Ghosts and spectres
- Wraiths call it home
- Deeply unsettling for living Garou

**Denizens:**
- Wraiths/ghosts
- Spectres
- Ancestor spirits
- Living visitors (rare)

### Deep Umbra
- Cosmic void beyond Near Realms
- Celestines dwell here
- Reality shifts constantly
- Disconnection is a real danger

**Denizens:**
- Celestines
- Incarnae
- Triat entities
- The Fera (some dwell here)
- Bunyip spirits (rumored)
