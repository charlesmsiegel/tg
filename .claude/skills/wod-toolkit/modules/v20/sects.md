## The Camarilla

### Overview
The Ivory Tower—oldest and largest sect. Enforces the Masquerade, claims domain over all vampires, maintains hierarchical control through tradition and elder power.

### Member Clans
- **Founding Seven**: Brujah, Gangrel, Malkavian, Nosferatu, Toreador, Tremere, Ventrue
- **Note**: Gangrel officially left circa 1999, but many remain Camarilla-aligned

### The Six Traditions

1. **The Masquerade**: Hide vampiric nature from mortals
2. **The Domain**: Respect claimed territory
3. **The Progeny**: Sire only with permission
4. **The Accounting**: Sire responsible for childer
5. **Hospitality**: Announce presence in another's domain
6. **Destruction**: Only elders may call Blood Hunt

### Titles & Positions

| Title | Role | Typical Generation |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| **Prince** | Rules city, final authority | 7th-9th |
| **Primogen** | Clan representative council | 8th-10th |
| **Seneschal** | Prince's second, deputy | 8th-10th |
| **Sheriff** | Enforces Prince's law | 9th-11th |
| **Keeper of Elysium** | Maintains neutral ground | 9th-12th |
| **Harpy** | Social arbiter, status keeper | Variable |

#### Optional: Harpy Status Effects (V20 Companion)
- **Favor**: +2 Status for scene duration
- **Disfavor**: -1 Status for scene (minimum 0)
- One effect at a time per Harpy

### Status System
Social currency in Camarilla:
- **Acknowledged**: Recognized member (basic)
- **Status Traits**: Earned through service, reputation
- Common traits: Revered, Well-Known, Influential, Powerful
- Status can be stripped by higher authority

### Camarilla Character Considerations
- Must respect traditions (especially Masquerade)
- Need permission to Embrace
- Politics matter—Status affects everything
- Elder approval needed for advancement
- Boons and prestation (favor trading) central

**Prestation System**: See `modules/prestation.md` for boon types, tracking, and discharge rules.

## The Sabbat

### Overview
The Sword of Caine—militant sect rejecting humanity. Views Camarilla as pawns of Antediluvians. Embraces vampiric nature, uses pack structure, wages holy war.

**Related Modules:**
- For detailed ritae mechanics → `modules/v20/ritae.md`
- For infernalism → `modules/v20/infernalism.md`

### Member Clans
- **Founding**: Lasombra, Tzimisce
- **Antitribu**: "Renegade" versions of Camarilla clans
- **Note**: Most Sabbat are mass-Embraced, Clan matters less

### Sabbat Practices

**The Vaulderie**:
- Ritual blood sharing creates Vinculum
- Pack loyalty bond (rated 1-10 between individuals)
- Breaks normal blood bonds
- Performed at pack rituals

**The Creation Rites**:
- Mass Embrace common
- Buried and must dig out (survival test)
- No gentle introduction—baptism by fire
- Creates pack mentality from start

**The Path System**:
- Reject Humanity as weakness
- Follow Paths of Enlightenment
- Common Paths: Path of Caine, Path of Cathari, Path of Death and the Soul, Path of Honorable Accord, Path of Power and the Inner Voice

### Titles & Positions

| Title | Role | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Regent** | Sabbat overall leader | Controls sect |
| **Cardinal** | Rules continent/region | Major power |
| **Priscus** | Clan representative | Advisory role |
| **Archbishop** | Rules city/diocese | Local authority |
| **Bishop** | Archbishop's officer | District control |
| **Ductus** | Pack war leader | Tactical command |
| **Pack Priest** | Spiritual leader | Leads ritae |
| **Templar** | Elite guard | Serves higher titles |
| **Paladin** | Archbishop's champion | Combat specialist |

**Full title mechanics**: See `modules/titles.md` and `lookup.py rules.titles titles`

### Pack Structure
- 3-10 members typical
- Ductus leads tactical/practical
- Pack Priest leads spiritual/ritual
- All members equal otherwise
- Pack above self, sect above pack

### Sabbat Character Considerations
- Choose or develop Path of Enlightenment
- Pack is family—absolute loyalty expected
- Frequent Vaulderie creates bonds
- War footing—combat common
- Less political, more direct action
- Humanity low or nonexistent

---

## The Anarch Movement

### Overview
Freedom fighters or anarchic rabble (depending on who you ask). Reject both Camarilla elders and Sabbat zealotry. Want vampire freedom and self-determination.

### Membership
- Any Clan can join
- Many Brujah, Gangrel, Caitiff
- Some disillusioned from other sects
- Thin-bloods often find haven here

### Anarch Philosophy
- No one rules by right of age alone
- Territory by mutual agreement
- Respect earned, not demanded
- Praxis through strength or consensus
- Masquerade often still maintained (practical)

### Titles & Positions

| Title | Role | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Baron** | Territory holder | Earned, not appointed |
| **Emissary** | Negotiator/diplomat | Speaks for Anarchs |
| **Sweeper** | Security/enforcement | Defends territory |

**Note**: Titles vary by city—Anarchs are decentralized

**Full title mechanics**: See `modules/titles.md` and `lookup.py rules.titles titles`

### Anarch Free States
- Los Angeles historically Anarch
- Various cities with Anarch control
- "Free State" = Anarch territory
- Status based on rep and respect

### Anarch Character Considerations
- Freedom focus but still social creatures
- Less formal hierarchy, more reputation-based
- May have left Camarilla or Sabbat
- Often younger/lower Generation
- Practical Masquerade adherence
- Gang/crew dynamics common

---

## Independents

### Overview
Clans not formally aligned with any sect. Navigate politics individually or as Clan.

### Independent Clans
| Clan | Typical Stance |
|------|----------------|
| **Assamites** | Hired killers, neutral providers |
| **Giovanni** | Family first, sect irrelevant |
| **Ravnos** | Wanderers, avoid entanglement |
| **Followers of Set** | Cult structure, own agenda |

### Independent Character Considerations
- Clan loyalty over sect
- May deal with any faction
- Often have own internal politics
- Outsider status—advantages and dangers

---

## Sect Conversion

### Camarilla → Sabbat
- Requires Creation Rites (re-Embrace ceremony)
- Old blood bonds broken by Vaulderie
- Status reset—start as newly-minted
- Former Camarilla often suspected

### Camarilla → Anarch
- Leave formally or flee
- May be declared Autarkis (outcast)
- Reputation carries partially
- Easier transition socially

### Sabbat → Camarilla
- Very rare—defector status
- May be hunted by Sabbat
- Never fully trusted by Camarilla
- Must prove loyalty extensively

### Sabbat → Anarch
- Break from pack is traumatic
- Vaulderie bonds fade slowly
- Path may need rethinking
- Sabbat considers traitor
