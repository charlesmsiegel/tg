# Paths of Enlightenment Module

## Overview
Paths of Enlightenment are alternative moral frameworks that allow vampires to maintain self-control without adhering to human morality. Essential for Sabbat characters and any vampire who has abandoned Humanity.

## Why Paths Exist

### The Problem with Humanity
- Vampires are predators—human morality condemns feeding
- Low Humanity leads to Wassail (mindless beast)
- Elders inevitably lose Humanity over centuries
- Some actions necessary for survival are "sins"

### The Solution
- Paths provide alternative ethical framework
- Different virtues guide behavior
- Still resist the Beast, but differently
- Allows functioning at low "Humanity-equivalent"

## Path Mechanics

### Path Rating
- Rated 1-10 like Humanity
- Determines dice pool to resist Frenzy
- Low rating = closer to Beast
- Zero = Wassail (same as Humanity)

### Virtues
Each Path uses different Virtues:
- **Conscience** → may become **Conviction** (certainty in beliefs)
- **Self-Control** → may become **Instinct** (riding the Beast)
- **Courage** remains Courage on all Paths

### Hierarchy of Sins
Each Path has its own hierarchy:
- Different acts constitute "sins"
- Violating tenets = degeneration roll
- What horrifies one Path may be virtue on another

### Adopting a Path
- Cannot simply "switch" from Humanity
- Requires Humanity 3 or below
- Needs teacher who follows Path
- Extended period of instruction
- Initial Path rating often lower than Humanity was

## Path Character Creation

### Step 1: Qualify
- Starting Humanity must be ≤3 to convert
- Or begin on Path if Sabbat character (Storyteller approval)

### Step 2: Choose Path
Match Path philosophy to character concept:
- Power-seeker → Path of Power
- Tzimisce fleshcrafter → Path of Metamorphosis
- Honorable warrior → Path of Honorable Accord
- Nihilist Lasombra → Path of Night
- Scholar of Caine → Path of Caine

### Step 3: Adjust Virtues
- Replace Conscience with Conviction if Path uses it
- Replace Self-Control with Instinct if Path uses it
- Courage remains for all Paths

### Step 4: Learn Tenets
Know the Path's hierarchy of sins thoroughly—this determines degeneration risks.

### Step 5: Roleplay Implications
- Path followers are NOT human
- Alien mindset, different morality
- May seem monstrous to Humanity followers
- Internal logic must be consistent
