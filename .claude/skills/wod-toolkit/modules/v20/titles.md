# Titles Module

## Overview
Kindred titles grant social standing, privileges, and responsibilities. This module covers title mechanics, creation, and sect-specific positions from V20 Companion.

---

## Title Mechanics

### Title as Background
Titles can be purchased as a Background (1-5 dots) or granted through roleplay.

**Point Values:**
- 1-point: Minor local authority
- 2-point: Significant local power
- 3-point: Major influence in domain
- 4-point: Regional/sect-wide authority
- 5-point: Ultimate sect authority

### Optional Systems

**Status Benefit**: Tie Status Background to title. Lose title = lose Status.

**Titles as Status Bonuses**: 
- Spend 1 Willpower
- Add title point value to Status dice pools for scene
- Failure = appear sycophantic or overbearing

**Negative Titles**:
- Cost nothing; cannot be bought off
- Subtract 1 from social dice pools with those aware of title
- If concealed and discovered, penalties may increase
- Examples: Quli, Outcast, Anathema

## Creating New Titles

### Guidelines
- Reflect unique domain/chronicle circumstances
- Create story hooks or impress other Kindred
- May be localized (e.g., "Huntsman" for anti-Lupine raids)

### Step-Based Effect System (Optional)

Each title dot grants 2 "steps" to spend on effects:

| Effect Type | Steps | Examples |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| Duration | 1-5 | Scene → Night → Month → Year → Permanent |
| Dice Modifier | 1-5 | +/-1 → +/-2 → +/-3 → +/-4 → +/-5 |
| Frequency | 1-5 | Once/term → Once/year → Once/month → Once/night → At will |
| Scope | 1-5 | Unique → Very narrow → Uncommon → Frequent → Universal |

**Restrictions:**
- No direct/indirect physical damage
- May affect only title-bearer's own traits
- Cannot force/prevent actions (only make difficult)
