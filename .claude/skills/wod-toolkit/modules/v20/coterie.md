## Quick Coterie Concepts

### The Survivors
Neonates Embraced during same crisis, bonded by shared trauma. No formal leader—decisions by consensus. Primarily concerned with survival and learning the rules.

### The Ambitious
Young vampires seeking to rise in sect hierarchy. Formal structure, political focus. Internal competition balanced against external cooperation.

### The Outcasts
Clanless, thin-bloods, or disgraced vampires. Loose alliance for protection. Seen as beneath notice by elders—which has advantages.

### The Specialists
Each member brings unique expertise. United by complex ongoing mission. Leader chosen per situation based on relevant skills.

### The Legacy
All Embraced by same sire or lineage. Strong blood loyalty, shared enemies. Carry on their sire's work or vendetta.
