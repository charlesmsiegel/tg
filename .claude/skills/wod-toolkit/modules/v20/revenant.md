# Revenant Module

Create revenants — mortals born to bloodlines that naturally produce vitae.

## What is a Revenant?

Revenants are mortals from family lineages engineered through blood magic to naturally produce vitae:
- Born with vitae in their veins (no need for regular feeding)
- Access to family Disciplines plus Potence
- Lesser form of the Beast and family-specific weaknesses
- Extended lifespan (age slowly)
- Can be blood bonded like ghouls
- Most serve Clan patrons (primarily Tzimisce)
