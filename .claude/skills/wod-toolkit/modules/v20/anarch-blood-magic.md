# Anarch Blood Magic Module

Create Anarch blood magicians and reference the four schools of Anarch sorcery.

---

## Overview

Blood magic among Anarchs is rarer than in Camarilla or Sabbat, but those who practice it provide powerful benefits to the Movement — and secure advantages for themselves.

**Key Difference**: Anarch magic is not unified. Four distinct schools exist, each with different philosophy, aesthetic, and botch effects.

---

## The Four Schools

| School | Philosophy | Aesthetic | Era |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| **Old Skool** | Traditional mysticism, religious devotion | Voudoun, Wicca, shamanism | Ancient |
| **New Age** | Spiritual holism, cosmic consciousness | Crystals, chakras, meditation | 1960s-70s |
| **Punk Sorcery** | Anti-authority chaos, urban legends | Graffiti sigils, blood and rage | 1970s-80s |
| **Hacktivist** | Technology as magic, information freedom | Code, networks, digital ritual | 1990s-present |

---

## School-Specific Botch Effects

Each school has unique consequences for failed magic:

| School | Botch Effect |
|--------|--------------|
| **Old Skool** | Acquire psychosomatic aversion to holy symbols (like Repelled by Crosses flaw). Rötschreck difficulty = 4 + sorcery rating. |
| **New Age** | Same as Old Skool |
| **Punk Sorcery** | Hysteria Derangement. Quicker to anger, delights in anarchic destruction of authority symbols. |
| **Setite Sorcery** | Intense photophobia. Bright lights trigger Rötschreck (difficulty 4 + path rating). Lector-priests exempt. |
| **Spirit Thaumaturgy** | Possession (or belief of possession). Multiple Personality Derangement with spirit-based personality. |

---

## Old Skool Sorcery

**Philosophy**: Religious devotion to obscure gods, spirits, or loa. Most traditionally "magical" of the schools.

**Common Traditions**: Voudoun, Wicca, Native American shamanism, pre-Christian European paganism, syncretic spiritualism

**Characteristics**:
- Require sanctified spaces
- Animal sacrifice common
- Blood offerings standard
- Ritual implements important
- Often run mortal cults

### Old Skool Rituals

#### Sanctify the Temple (Level 1)
Create sacred space for magical working.

**Requirements**: Indoor space decorated with patron's iconography + animal sacrifice. Outdoor spaces need less decoration but risk discovery.

**Effect**: -1 difficulty to all Old Skool paths/rituals performed within.

**Duration**: One lunar month (renewable)

**Size by Successes**:
- 1 success: 5×5 ft (walk-in closet, tiny grove)
- 3 successes: 20×20 ft (small church sanctuary, large grove)
- 5 successes: 100 sq ft (medium church, small wood)

#### Haruspicy (Level 2)
Divination through animal entrails.

**Requirements**: 
- Sanctified space
- Animal sacrifice (poultry = 1 blood point; sheep+ = 2 blood points; human = Degeneration roll)
- Personal item from subject
- Cannot read for self

**System**: Each success = 1 question about past/present. 2 successes = 1 question about future.

**Modifiers**: Larger sacrifice -1 difficulty. Human sacrifice -3 difficulty. Stacks with temple bonus.

**Limit**: One reading per subject every 7 nights.

#### Craft Dream Catcher (Level 3)
Protective item against spirits and mental intrusion during sleep.

**Requirements**: Hand-crafted item with target's hair, blood (< 1 point), and spittle.

**Duration**: 1 week per success

**Effects** (while within 5 ft of owner):
- +2 difficulty for spirit attacks against owner
- +2 difficulty for mind/dream influence while sleeping
- -2 difficulty for vampires to awaken during day when in danger

#### Houngan's Doll (Level 4)
Effigy for observation and sensation (not damage like Baleful Doll).

**Construction**: Same as Baleful Doll requirements.

**Duration**: Until destroyed (no effect on target)

**Activation**: Once per week. Light votive candle floating in cup of 1 blood point. Lasts ~30 minutes.

**Effects**:
- See and hear through target's senses (caster blind/deaf to own surroundings)
- Inflict non-damaging physical sensations (pin prick hurts but doesn't wound)
- Tickling, temperature sensations, etc.
- Can trigger Rötschreck with flame near doll's head

#### Skinwalker's Belt (Level 5)
Transform into animal whose pelt was ritually prepared.

**Requirements**: 
- Ritually sacrifice animal (mouse to bear size)
- In Sanctified Temple space
- Cure pelt 3 nights in brine + caster's blood (1 point for <human size, 3 for human size, 5 for >human size)

**Effect**: Wear pelt to become perfect copy of sacrificed animal.

**Detection**: Werewolves detect "unclean." Aura Perception shows "undead" (likely mistaken for Animalism possession).

---

## New Age Sorcery

**Philosophy**: Spiritual evolution, cosmic consciousness, harmony with universe. Often incorporates Eastern mysticism.

**Common Traditions**: Theosophy, New Thought, Buddhist/Hindu elements, crystal healing, chakra work, astral projection

**Characteristics**:
- Meditation-based
- Less blood sacrifice, more energy work
- Focus on self-improvement
- Often vegetarian (among mortals in cult)
- Communal practices

### Notable New Age Groups

**The Unity Brethren**: Seek to develop gestalt intelligence using blood magic and advanced Auspex.

**The Maenads**: Radical feminist Old Skoolers who worship the Malkavian Antediluvian as avatar of Dionysus.

---

## Punk Sorcery

**Philosophy**: Magic as rebellion against authority. Urban legends as power source. Chaos as creative force.

**Common Traditions**: Urban folklore, graffiti magic, chaos magick, street shamanism, industrial ritual

**Characteristics**:
- Deliberately transgressive
- Street art as magical sigils
- Urban legends as spirits
- Confrontational and provocative
- Often tied to mortal subcultures (punk, goth, metal)

### Punk Sorcery Rituals

#### Eyes on the Street (Level 2)
Enchant surveillance cameras to serve as mystic eyes.

**Requirements**: Caster's blood smeared on camera lens.

**Duration**: 1 lunar month

**Effect**: Spend blood point to see through that camera. Can maintain multiple at once.

#### Friend of a Friend (Level 3)
Invoke urban legend as temporary ally.

**Requirements**: Tell the legend's story while spilling blood. More elaborate telling = better results.

**Effect**: Entity from urban legend manifests and performs one task consistent with its nature. (Hook Man attacks, Bloody Mary frightens, vanishing hitchhiker delivers message, etc.)

**Warning**: Entity follows its own nature. May interpret instructions creatively.

### Notable Punk Groups

**Mary's Kids**: Claim to have bound Bloody Mary into their service.

---

## Hacktivist Thaumaturgy

**Philosophy**: Technology IS magic. The digital realm follows its own arcane laws. Information wants to be free.

**Common Traditions**: Technomancy, chaos mathematics, memetic engineering, viral sorcery

**Characteristics**:

- Networks as mystic connections
- Often work remotely
- Data as sacrifice (rather than blood)

**Requirements**: Previously recorded video of caster on target device.

**Duration**: 7 nights

**System**: Roll pool from successes. Spend to observe (diff 4) or control display (diff 7). Botch ends effect.

#### Non-Disclosure Clause (Level 4)
Secure information transfer with failsafe.

**Requirements**: Enchanted text file, encrypted and emailed.

**Process**: Recipient agrees by placing blood on screen square. Information downloads directly into mind.

**Effect**: Eidetic recall of information. If captured/interrogated by Movement enemies, information vanishes (may be replaced by disinformation if 3+ successes).

**Limitation**: Cannot transfer Disciplines, rituals, or Abilities. Data only.

#### Ghost in the System (Level 5)
Create or modify digital identity.

**Requirements**: Extended Intelligence + Occult roll, one full night per roll.

**Effect**: Create entire paper trail for identity OR modify existing records. Only physical hard copies reveal truth.

## Anarch Blood Magic Economics

### In Camarilla Territories

**Political Reality**: 
- Tremere want monopoly on blood magic
- But attacking Anarch practitioners causes backlash
- Tremere seen as assholes for trying to suppress magic
- Result: Grudging tolerance, waiting for screw-ups

**Anarch Strategy**:
- Provide alternatives to Tremere services
- Build goodwill for Movement
- Some operate openly as gadflies
- "Chameleons" work undercover

### In Free States

**Advantages**: No Tremere interference

**Dangers**: 
- Rival Anarch sorcerers free to act on rivalries
- Paranoid Anarchs suspicious of all blood magic
- Four antagonistic schools create confusion

**Structure**: About half of all Anarch coteries have one "weirdo" advisor on occult matters.

### Pricing

No standard exchange rate. Seller's market.

**Payment Types**:
- Cash (thousands for minor work; hundreds of thousands for high-level rituals)
- Service to coterie/school
- Participation in mundane rites (Old Skool, New Age)
- Proving "you don't suck" through reckless vandalism (Punk)
- Demonstrating worthiness to enter hacker cliques (Hacktivist)

**Services Offered**:
- Security wards
- Assassination
- Hexes
- Blood-laced intoxicants
- Stored spells in amulets/scrolls/programs
- Masquerade-safe Internet posting

---

## Hacking Rituals

Anarchs often adapt rituals from other schools to their own tradition.

**Process**: Remove auspicious elements from original, replace with own school's elements.

**Time**: Weeks or months

**Risk**: Fraught with potential danger

**Result**: Ritual works with new school's aesthetic and botch effects.
