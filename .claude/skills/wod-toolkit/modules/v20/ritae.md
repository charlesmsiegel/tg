# Sabbat Ritae Module

Create and reference Sabbat ritae — faith-powered blood magic unique to the Sword of Caine.

---

## Overview

Ritae are a unique form of magic powered by blood AND faith. Unlike Thaumaturgy, they draw power from:
- **Auctoritas Ritae**: Faith in Caine and the Sect
- **Pack Ignoblis**: Loyalty to packmates
- **Faction Ritae**: Belief in political ideals

Even disbelievers can participate if they respect the ritual — the faith of others compensates. However, doubt is more problematic in smaller groups.

**Key Rule**: Ritae are blood magic and ARE affected by things that resist/counter blood magic. Active ritae show in auras as "a bloody wash over the spirit that manifests as a blend of sorcery and faith."

---

## Ritae vs. Thaumaturgy

| Aspect | Ritae | Thaumaturgy |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Power Source | Faith + Blood | Blood alone |
| Learning | Rituals Background | Path/Ritual system |
| Flexibility | Fixed ceremonies | Customizable |
| Detection | Aura shows faith+sorcery | Aura shows sorcery |
| Counter | Blood magic counters work | Blood magic counters work |

## The Auctoritas Ritae (High Ritae)

The thirteen sacred rituals canonized by the Regent. No True Sabbat can be refused the right to learn these (with pack priest approval), though finding a willing teacher is another matter.

## Detailed Auctoritas Mechanics

### The Monomacy

Ritual single combat to resolve disputes. Cannot be refused without loss of face/status.

**Participants**:
- **Challenger**: Initiates the Monomacy
- **Challenged**: Must accept or lose status
- **Arbiter**: Pack Priest or Bishop who sets terms

**Terms Set by Arbiter**:
- Combat type (melee, firearms, supernatural, to the pain, etc.)
- Environment (standard arena or exotic location)
- Ritual trappings (witnesses, delays up to one month)
- Only the arbiter may declare a Monomacy null and void

**Outcome Options** (chosen by victor):
1. **Death** — Including diablerie; must occur in the circle by victor's hands
2. **Exile** — From specific territory
3. **Loss of Position** — Replaced via normal Sect means

**Note on Exit**: If a competitor is forced OUT of the circle (by powers or otherwise), death is no longer an option — victor chooses only exile or position loss.

**Possessions**: Slain losers' possessions go to the winner. Surviving losers keep theirs.

**Templars**: Do NOT fight in their liege's place. Leaders are expected to be capable (though "capable" can mean clever Discipline use to force opponents out without raising a hand).

---

### The Vaulderie

**Size**: 10-15 members maximum per Vaulderie. Large gatherings perform MANY small Vaulderies — between packs, along Clan lines, within factions, or among those with similar ethics.

**Politics**: Who you Vaulderie with first (or avoid) at gatherings is a political statement. Observers learn much by watching Vaulderie circle patterns through the night.

**System**: Creates Vinculum ratings (1-10) between participants. See V20 p. 510 for base mechanics.

---

### The War Party

Confers Caine's blessing for hunting a specific, named enemy of the Sect.

**Duration**: Until next sunrise

**Compulsion**: Once cast, participants CANNOT turn from their purpose, even if target is unreachable or victory impossible. They will drive themselves to death in increasingly desperate attempts.

**System Additions** (beyond V20 p. 510):
- All participants gain **3 free bonus dice** for actions pursuing/attacking their specific target
- Dice are spent when used (declared before rolling)
- May use multiple dice on one challenge
- Beast grows stronger as night progresses — roleplay increasing recklessness
- Priest can cast on up to (permanent Willpower × 3) vampires

**Consequences**: Failure without death of target brings great shame.

---

### The Wild Hunt

Hunts a specific, named TRAITOR (not just any enemy).

**Requirements**:
- Target must be Sabbat member
- Target must have betrayed the Sect tangibly

**Process**:
1. Priest publicly announces **Bans of the Hunt** (charges) and a location
2. Accused has **3 nights** to appear and answer charges
3. If rebuttal is judged sufficient by gathered Ducti → accuser must commute to contrition
4. If rebuttal is inadequate → accused may challenge accuser to Monomacy
5. If no challenge/no appearance → ritual is performed at end of third night

**System Additions** (beyond V20 pp. 510-511):
- Target gains **mystical ever-bleeding scar** (Sabbat sigil shape) on forehead, neck, or hand
- Scar persists until Final Death OR pardon by the Regent (only the Regent can pardon)
- Target loses ALL Status dots and positions
- Cannot benefit from ANY Sabbat ritae
- All Vinculi TO the target break immediately (their Vinculi toward others remain)

**Distinction**: "False Sabbat" (redemption possible) vs "Traitor" (no redemption). Traitors are hunted and destroyed with extreme prejudice.

---

## Black Cathedrals

Sacred locations that focus ritual magic like a prism, enabling larger and more powerful ritae.

**Current Black Cathedrals**:
- Mexico City
- Montreal
- Bucharest

**Requirements**: Only a Black Cathedral can perform:
- Blood Bath to invest a Regent
- Certain high-level combined ritae

**Construction**: Rare, much-celebrated events requiring a Synod.

---

## Synods and Ecumenical Councils

### Ecumenical Councils
- Informal gatherings of packs
- Discuss doctrine, theology, philosophy, ritual practice
- Occur many times per year
- Learning and argumentation outside formal ritae

### Synods
- Called on special occasion for MAJOR issues
- Can add/alter Auctoritas Ritae
- Perform Blood Baths for Consistory members
- Found Black Cathedrals
- Clarify Sect religious beliefs

---

## The Ignoblis Ritae (Pack Ritae)

Less structured, more personal. Rely on individual loyalty rather than Sect-wide faith. Created by pack priests to foster pack loyalty.

**Key Difference**: Not canonized, not in Code of Milan. Priests often hoard these, refusing to teach non-allies.

See V20 p. 511 for base Ignoblis information.

---

## Faction Ritae

Rituals tied to political factions. **Requirements**:
- Must have undergone Creation Rites
- At least 3 dots in Rituals Background
- Must be a genuine believer in the faction's goals
- Minimum 3 faction members to cast (only one needs to know the ritual)

**Infiltration Prevention**: If a spy with divergent beliefs participates, the ritual FAILS — making long-term infiltration nearly impossible.

**Faction Switching**: Leaving a faction means losing ability to cast its ritae.

---

## Ultra Conservative Faction Ritae

**Philosophy**: Strong leaders, strict hierarchy, intensive training, Vaulderie between ALL packs of a diocese. Goal: unified Sabbat nation abandoning cellular pack structure.

### Irad's Wall
Prevents spirits, wraiths, and astral forms from entering a sanctified area.

**Casting**: Consecrate area (≤100 sq yards/meters) with incense and salt.

**Effects** (lasts until sunrise):
- Spirits/wraiths/astral forms cannot enter
- If a body whose spirit is elsewhere crosses barrier → spirit returns immediately (ends Possession, Astral Projection, Soul Stealing, etc.)
- Characters who leave bodies inside cannot leave the area until their bodies cross the barrier

### The Renunciation
Initiation into Ultra Conservative faction.

**Process**:
1. Petitioner swears formal oath of allegiance
2. Priest stakes petitioner publicly (willing or not)
3. Priest recites Sermon of Caine over staked form
4. Stake removed (symbolizing overcoming death/Embrace)
5. Welcomed by faction peers

**Oath**: "I (name), pledge to uphold the Sect, its rightful clergy, and its sacred goals, in the name of the Dark Father. Stability through discipline. Unity through constancy. Victory through relentlessness. I will prove my worth. I swear it, upon the altar of Caine."

**System**: Gain permanent +1 die to Self-Control/Instinct rolls while Ultra Conservative and acting to uphold faction ideals. Breaking the ritual (e.g., killing staked petitioner) brings severe punishment.

---

## Orthodox Faction Ritae

**Philosophy**: Religious fervor, ritae emphasis, priests above militants, narrower heresy definition (to allow more magical research).

### Atra Sacramentum
Penance offering to the Dark Father for sins of the Antediluvians.

**Process**: Performed before altar fire. Each participant slices off a small portion of flesh (finger or similar) while offering prayer.

**System**:
- Take 2 unsoakable aggravated damage (healing ends the effect)
- Until next sunset: **Clan weakness does not apply**
- Can only benefit once per lunar month
- Lasts one night only

**Clan Weakness Notes**: Physical alterations (Nosferatu, Kiasyd, Harbingers) are lessened but not eliminated — they lose associated benefits too. Mechanics requiring those alterations don't function while active.

### The Last Rites
Cast on someone about to enter a likely fatal situation.

**Requirements**: Orthodox faction member casting on someone they have Vinculum with.

**Process**: Melt silver bar in brazier. Target presses fingers into molten metal (1 unsoakable lethal). Healing ends effect.

**Effects** (until next sunrise):
- Caster knows instantly if target dies
- If target dies (without diablerie), caster can "reclaim" soul by willing it
- Mechanically like caster performed diablerie (no stat gain, but soul joined)
- Caster receives vision of target's final moments from their POV

---

## Loyalist Faction Ritae

**Philosophy**: Freedom over unity, minimal hierarchy, rule by community will, nomadic values, Native American shamanic influences.

### Purity of Babel
Secure communication even in larger gatherings.

**System**: Up to 10 Loyalists can communicate in an indecipherable manner for the rest of the night. Can be verbal OR gestures (works over video/phones). Those in different Purity of Babel rituals cannot understand each other. Communication is obvious; only meaning is obscured.

### Calling the Directions
Invoking spirits of the four winds to reconnect with the living world.

**Requirements**: At least 4 participants, one per direction. Often involves dancing, drumming, ecstatic practices.

**Benefits** (until next sunrise):

| Direction | Wind Of | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| East | Speed, mental swiftness | +1 Initiative |
| South | Passion, emotion, breath | +1 Humanity aura for mortals (or removes negatives if on Path) |
| West | Wisdom, knowledge | +1 to chosen non-combat Skill |
| North | Mountains, constancy | +1 Healthy wound box |

Extra participants choose which quarter to assist, gaining that quarter's benefit.

## Order of St. Blaise Faction Ritae

**Philosophy**: Protect Sabbat cities through mortal influence. Maintain Humanity to interact with mortals. Critical for modern surveillance age.

### Martyr's Eyes
Early warning system using blood-bound servants.

**Process**: Cast once, then permanent while blood connection exists.

**Effect**: When someone containing caster's blood (ghoul or high Vinculum) is truly frightened or in danger, caster receives flash of insight showing WHO is endangered and general cause (attack, fall, police, werewolf, etc.).

### The Blessing of Saint Blaise
Protection against ingested substances.

**Process**: Consecrate pair of candles. Press crossed to recipient's neck. Recite: "Through the invocation of Saint Blaise, bishop and martyr of the Sword, may Caine deliver you from ailments."

**Effect**: Cures any harmful effects from ingestion. Grants protection against ingested substances for 7 days.

---

## Pander Caucus

Lower political power in recent nights. Represents the clanless and mass-Embraced.

## Status Quo

Lower political power in recent nights. Focuses on maintaining current Sect structure.

## Moderates

No faction affiliation, no faction ritae.

---

## Merit: Mark of Caine (4pt Supernatural)

**Requirement**: Pre-First Sabbat Civil War vampire who participated in the lost Mark of Caine ritus. Must be on a spiritual Path of Enlightenment.

**Effect**:
- Gain twisted True Faith (1 dot effects, using symbols of Caine as holy symbols)
- +2 dice to resist mortal True Faith

**Loss Condition**: Reverts to Humanity or enters wassail → Merit lost forever.

---

## Ritual Elevation Process

How an Ignoblis becomes an Auctoritas:

1. Large body of pack priests petition Grand Inquisitor
2. Grand Inquisitor confirms no heresy, infernal ties, or dark thaumaturgy
3. Grand Inquisitor unifies language and practice
4. Manuscript brought to Synod of Consistory
5. Consistory debates purpose, function, and benefit
6. Priests may speak for or against
7. Consistory determines value
