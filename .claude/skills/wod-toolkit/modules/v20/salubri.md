# Salubri Module

Create mechanically valid Salubri characters for V20, including all branches and variants.

## Overview

The Salubri are one of the original 13 Clans, descended from Saulot. Once respected as healers and seekers of Golconda, they were nearly exterminated when the Tremere diablerized Saulot and began a pogrom. Survivors hide among mortal communities, hunted by Tremere and feared by those who believe the Tremere propaganda.

## The Third Eye

All Salubri manifest a **third eye** in the center of their forehead. This is:
- Normally closed (appears as faint scar)
- Opens when using Disciplines (especially Obeah/Valeren)
- Opens involuntarily when sensing pain or distress nearby
- Weeps blood when the Salubri feeds (costs 1 blood point per feeding)

## The Seven

A controversial faction. Seven elders who sought Golconda returned as "deranged bodhisattvas" who:
- Embrace single childer
- Guide childer toward diablerie of the sire
- Believe they persist within the diablerist's soul
- Rip out mortal souls for unknown purposes

**The Eighth (6pt. Flaw)**: Your sire is one of the Seven. You are hunted by Tremere AND by the Seven's followers.

---

## Common Weakness

**All Salubri share**:
1. **Third Eye**: Opens when using Disciplines or sensing suffering
2. **Weeping Blood**: Lose 1 blood point per feeding as eye weeps
3. **Hunted**: Tremere actively seek Salubri for destruction

### Flaws

## Roleplaying Considerations

### Hiding Identity
Salubri must constantly hide:
- Third eye covered (hats, bandanas, makeup, hair)
- Claim to be Caitiff if bloodline questioned
- Avoid using Obeah/Valeren visibly
- Don't trust Tremere or their allies

### Typical Havens
- Religious communities
- Hospitals and clinics
- Poor neighborhoods
- Areas with strong mortal community bonds

### Feeding
- Blood weeping: Lose 1 BP per feeding (factored into sustenance)
- Many maintain Herds (Background)
- Feed from those they heal/help

### Humanity
- Most Salubri maintain high Humanity (7+)
- Warrior antitribu may follow Paths but often struggle
- Golconda remains the ultimate goal for many

---

## Sample Concepts

### Ad-Hoc Emissary
Your healing abilities have made you valuable to supernatural factions. A werewolf's wife, a Toreador's favorite ghoul - you've helped many. Now you serve as neutral diplomat, protected by favors owed. The Prince keeps asking how much leverage you have while Tremere watch from the shadows.

### Chosen One
Your sire was one of the Seven. They prepared you to continue their "legacy" of sacred diablerie. Instead, you ran. Now you hide from both Tremere hunters AND your sire's followers who want you to complete your "sacred duty."

### Military Doctor
Embraced by an al-Amin elder during a modern conflict. Your compassion for wounded soldiers - enemies included - marked you. Now you serve the scattered remnants of your bloodline as their envoy in Camarilla territory, your foreign status providing cover.

## Historical Notes

### Timeline
- **Second City**: Saulot served as peacekeeper among the Third Generation
- **Saulot's Journey**: Traveled east, returned with third eye and Golconda knowledge
- **Baali Wars**: Salubri fought demons in ancient times
- **1133 CE**: Tremere diablerize Saulot; pogroms begin
- **1489 CE**: Convention of Thorns; Tremere legitimized, Salubri hunts intensify
- **1525 CE**: Mokur (Saulot's childe) destroyed by Etrius
- **Modern Nights**: Adonai's Warriors resurface in Sabbat

### The Precept of Samiel
Warriors follow ancient martial codes:
- Never rest in same place too long
- Always oppose tyranny
- Protect the innocent
- Seek worthy foes
