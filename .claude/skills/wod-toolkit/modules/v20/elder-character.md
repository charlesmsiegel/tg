# Elder Character Module

Create mechanically valid elder Vampire characters (8th generation and below) for V20.

## When to Use This Module

Use this module when creating:
- **Ancillae** (8th-10th generation, 100-300 years undead)
- **Elders** (6th-8th generation, 300-1000 years undead)
- **Methuselahs** (4th-5th generation, 1000+ years undead)

For standard neonates (10th-13th generation), use `modules/v20/character.md` instead.

## Experience Guidelines

Rather than standard character creation, elder characters are typically built with bonus experience:

| Category | Suggested XP | Typical Traits |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Ancilla | 50-150 XP | Multiple 4-dot Abilities, 4-5 in clan Disciplines |
| Elder | 150-300 XP | 5+ in primary Disciplines, out-of-clan Disciplines, extensive Backgrounds |
| Methuselah | 300+ XP | 6-7+ in Disciplines, legendary Abilities, massive Background networks |

### XP Costs (Standard V20)

| Trait | Cost |
|-------|------|
| Attribute | Current × 4 |
| Ability | Current × 2 |

## Elder Character Creation Steps

### 1. Concept & History
- **Era of Embrace**: What historical period? What revolution or upheaval?
- **Centuries Active**: How long awake vs. in torpor?
- **Cultural Background**: Languages, skills, and attitudes from mortal life
- **Kindred History**: Sire, early unlife, major events survived

### 2. Base Character
Start with standard character creation, then add XP:
- Attributes: 7/5/3 + XP purchases
- Abilities: 13/9/5 + XP purchases
- Disciplines: 3 (Clan) + XP purchases
- Backgrounds: 5 + XP purchases
- Virtues: 7 + XP
- Freebies: 15

### 3. Apply Experience
Spend bonus XP appropriate to age category.

**Elder Discipline Guidelines:**
- Primary clan Discipline: 5-6 (7 for Methuselahs)
- Secondary clan Disciplines: 4-5
- Out-of-clan Disciplines: 2-4 (requires in-story justification)

### 4. Torpor & Memory
Consider periods of torpor:
- **Recent Awakening**: May have Amnesia flaw, culture shock
- **Sporadic Activity**: Gaps in historical knowledge
- **Continuous Activity**: Better adaptation but more enemies

### 5. Extended Backgrounds
Elders typically have extensive Background networks. Document each:
- **Allies**: Name specific individuals, their power, and history
- **Contacts**: Detail networks by field (criminal, political, occult)
- **Influence**: Specify domains (media, finance, government)
- **Resources**: Detail sources and vulnerabilities
- **Retainers**: Full ghoul/servant profiles
- **Status**: Position in sect hierarchy

### 6. Morality
Many elders follow alternative Paths of Enlightenment:
- **Path of Caine**: Common among Sabbat elders
- **Path of Blood**: Assamite standard
- **Path of Bones**: Cappadocian/Giovanni
- **Path of Night**: Lasombra

Elders on Humanity often have lower ratings (3-5) from centuries of necessary cruelty.

### 7. Derangements
Long unlife often produces psychological damage:
- Obsessions related to mortal life or Embrace circumstances
- Anachronistic behaviors
- Paranoia (often justified)
- Memory disturbances from torpor

| Flaw | Points | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Amnesia | 2 | Torpor erased significant memories |

| Enemy | 1-5 | Accumulated rivals and grudges |
