# Blood Brothers Module

Create Blood Brothers — artificial vampires manufactured by the Sabbat through combined Tremere antitribu and Tzimisce magic.

---

## Overview

Blood Brothers are brutal foot soldiers created through unprecedented collaboration between Tremere antitribu and Tzimisce. Unlike Gargoyles, they are:

- Created in batches (3-10 individuals with connected psyches)
- Absolutely infertile (cannot Embrace)
- More stable than Gargoyles
- Psychologically dim and unimaginative (protective trait)

**Status Debate**: The Sabbat is divided on whether Blood Brothers are:
- Children of Caine deserving freedom
- Modified vampires to be treated as True Sabbat
- Creatures like szlachta/vozhd to be kept in chains

Treatment varies by diocese.

## Creation vs. Gargoyles

| Aspect | Blood Brothers | Gargoyles |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Source Material | 10 mortal children | 2+ vampires (Nosferatu, Tzimisce, Gangrel) |
| Creation Time | ~6 weeks | ~3 months |
| Process | Living fusion | Corpse assembly |
| Result | Batch of 3-10 linked individuals | Single individual |
| Fertility | Absolutely infertile | Can Embrace (unusual) |
| Stability | Very stable | Prone to revolt |
| Psychology | Dim, unimaginative | Variable |
| Trauma | Less traumatic (one→many) | More traumatic (many→one) |

## The Mirror of Blood Ritual

**Level**: 5 (Thaumaturgy OR Koldunic Sorcery)

**Collaboration**: Created jointly by Tremere antitribu and Tzimisce. Represents centuries of trial and error. Considered either heresy against vampiric nature OR pinnacle of unified magical research.

### Requirements

**Subjects**: 10 children less than 7 years old
- Any race or sex
- Must ALL share same blood type
- No diseases or genetic imperfections

**Materials**:
- Large stone container (bathtub-sized or larger)
- Blood from each participant
- Alchemical compounds
- Ritual implements

### Process

1. **Preparation** (1 week): Children are kept in ritual space, given alchemical compounds
2. **Blood Sharing**: Each child drinks mixture containing blood from all others
3. **The Fusion**: Tzimisce uses Vicissitude to merge children's flesh while Tremere antitribu chants binding incantations
4. **The Division**: After three nights of fusion, the mass is separated into individual bodies
5. **The Awakening**: Each body receives the Embrace simultaneously

### System

**Rolls**: Extended Intelligence + Occult (difficulty 9)
- Tzimisce handles physical transformation
- Tremere handles mystical binding
- Both must succeed for ritual to work

**Duration**: Approximately 6 weeks total

**Result**: 3-10 Blood Brothers (Storyteller determines exact number based on successes)

**Failure Effects**:
- Simple failure: Subjects die, must start over
- Botch: Catastrophic results (subjects fuse permanently into mindless mass, ritual backfires on casters, etc.)

**Morality**: Attempted use removes 1 morality point regardless of path. The ritual is deeply abhorrent.

## Blood Brother Characteristics

### The Psychic Link

All Blood Brothers from the same ritual share:
- Emotional connection (feel each other's strong emotions)
- Awareness of siblings' general state (alive, injured, in danger)
- Coordinated combat instincts
- Shared memories of creation trauma

**Mechanical Effect**: Blood Brothers from same "circle" gain:
- +1 to coordination rolls when working together
- Cannot be surprised if any sibling is aware of threat
- Feel compulsion to protect siblings

### Physical Traits

- Generally large and muscular
- Often have visible Vicissitude modifications
- Appearance varies by creator's preferences
- Typically lack distinctive individual features

### Mental Traits

- Intelligence tends toward low-average
- Limited imagination (protective against creation trauma)
- Strong pack loyalty
- Excellent at following orders
- Poor at independent problem-solving

## Blood Brothers as Characters

### As Antagonists
- Sabbat shock troops
- Haven guards for Tzimisce/Tremere antitribu
- Expendable soldiers in sect conflicts
- Horror elements (what was done to create them)

### As Player Characters (Rare)

**Considerations**:
- Limited social capability
- Dependent on circle-mates
- Stigma within Sabbat
- No possibility of childer

**Modified Creation**:
- May have higher mental stats (unusual specimen)
- May have broken from circle (traumatic, Derangement likely)
- May be "adopted" by a pack

---

## Blood Brother Circles

A "circle" is a group of Blood Brothers created from the same ritual.

### Circle Dynamics

| Circle Size | Combat Effectiveness | Independence | Stability |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------|-----------|
| 3 | Moderate | Higher | Lower |
| 5 | High | Moderate | Moderate |
| 10 | Extreme | Low | High |

### Circle Bonds

Blood Brothers within a circle have Vinculum-like bonds to each other (rating 7-9 typically). This is not true Vinculum but a side effect of the creation process.

### Broken Circles

When circle-mates die:
- Surviving brothers feel psychic trauma
- May develop Derangements
- Bond to remaining siblings strengthens
- Last survivor often becomes unstable

## Sabbat Treatment by Diocese

| **War Ghouls** | Treated like szlachta, kept chained except for battle | Conservative dioceses |
| **Property** | Belong to creating Tremere/Tzimisce | Some traditional areas |

## Creating Blood Brother NPCs

### Step 1: Circle Size
Determine how many brothers exist (3-10).

### Step 2: Creator
Identify the Tremere antitribu and Tzimisce responsible. This affects:
- Physical appearance (Tzimisce aesthetic)
- Training and purpose
- Current ownership/loyalty

### Step 3: Status
Determine treatment level (True Sabbat, Lesser Member, etc.).

### Step 4: Purpose
What are they used for?
- Haven guards
- Shock troops
- Assassination teams
- Expendable scouts

### Step 5: Individual Variation
Despite shared creation, brothers may have slight individual traits:
- One slightly smarter
- One more aggressive
- One who questions orders
- One developing independent personality
