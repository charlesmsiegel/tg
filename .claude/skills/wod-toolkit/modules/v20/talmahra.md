# Tal'Mahe'Ra (True Black Hand) Module

## Overview
The Tal'Mahe'Ra is an ancient sect predating both Camarilla and Sabbat, claiming a lineage of 3,000+ years. They guard the First City (Enoch) in the Shadowlands, prepare for Gehenna, and work to ensure the Antediluvians' rise results in the extinction of Cainite kind—freeing humanity.

**Also Known As**: True Black Hand, True Hand, Manus Nigrum (historical)

---

## Core Ideology

### The Gehenna Doctrine
- The Antediluvians **will** rise and consume all Kindred
- After consuming their childer, the Antediluvians will perish
- The Blood of Caine will vanish from Earth
- Humanity (Children of Seth) will finally be free
- The Tal'Mahe'Ra works to ensure this happens *correctly*

### Three Pillars
1. **Shepherd the Kine** — Protect humanity from supernatural predation
2. **Dismay our Siblings** — Disrupt vampires who don't share True Hand views
3. **Respect our Neighbors** — Combat infernalism and demonic corruption

## Sect Rules

### On Diablerie
- **Forbidden** without express permission of the Wazir council
- Those responsible for destroying Antediluvians are forbidden membership
- Tremere responsible for Salubri destruction: forbidden
- Giovanni who diablerized Cappadocians: forbidden
- Regular unjustified diablerie: forbidden
- Distinction exists between "reclaiming blood of traitors" and "unrestrained bloodlust"

### On Thin-Bloods
- Creation of Kindred beyond 10th Generation is disdained
- 13th-15th Generation seen as signs of Gehenna
- Seraphim and dominions attempt to purge Thin-Blooded when unnoticed
- Instinctive aggression toward Thin-Blooded—something in the blood demands culling

### On Infiltration
- Members maintain cover identities in Camarilla, Sabbat, or as Independents
- At least one seraph sits on Camarilla Inner Circle as Justicar
- At least two Archbishops and a Cardinal are True Hand agents
- Work to maintain maximum conflict between Camarilla and Sabbat

### The False Hand
- The Sabbat's "Black Hand" is called the "False Hand" by Tal'Mahe'Ra
- True Hand has fingers in the False Hand
- Uses False Hand as cover—best place to hide is in plain sight
- Disseminates half-truths and lies to maintain concealment
