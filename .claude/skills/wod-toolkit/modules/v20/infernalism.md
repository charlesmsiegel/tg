# Infernalism Module

Create infernalist characters, demonic pacts, investments, and Dark Thaumaturgy practitioners.

**Warning**: Infernalism is typically antagonist material. Player characters with infernal ties face severe in-game consequences and moral degradation.

---

## Overview

Infernalism is the practice of bargaining with demons for power. Unlike other blood magic, it requires no innate talent — anyone can become an infernalist if they know how to call a demon and are willing to pay the price.

**Key Principle**: Demons are creatures of pure spirit — withered, foul, and corrupt, but pure spirit nonetheless. They are not bound by physical laws and can break the rules of physics, culture, and even the laws of God.

---

## The Path to Damnation

### How Vampires Fall

Demons don't approach the strong and successful. They target the desperate — those who have lost everything, faced impossible odds, or have deep personal weaknesses. Common patterns:

1. **The Desperate Gamble**: Everything is lost. The demon offers one chance.
2. **The Slow Slide**: Small favors leading to larger debts.
3. **The Noble Sacrifice**: Selling one's soul to save another.
4. **The Power Seeker**: Deliberately seeking infernal power.
5. **The Deceived**: Tricked into a pact through manipulation.

**The Cruel Truth**: Those with the most to lose — humanists, honorable vampires — are often the easiest to turn when everything hangs by a thread.

## Demonic Entities

### The Archdukes of Hell

The most powerful demonic forces, capable of granting the greatest powers at the highest costs.

| Archduke | Portfolio | Typical Bargains |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Belial the Warlord** | Pride, destruction, revenge | Acts through terrorist cells, suicide bombers; appreciates capacity for destruction |
| **Abbadon the Devourer** | Fleshly pleasures, torment | Many followers trade souls for noble purposes; can utterly annihilate souls (unique power) |
| **Dagon** (Vassago, Leviathan, Behemoth) | Envy, organization, hierarchy | Political and financial power; watches dreams turn to ash |
| **Asmodai the Throned** | Pride, beauty, success | Offers beauty, fame, success; the wisest duke; appears beautiful |
| **Azrael the Slayer** | Cunning, deception, games of chance | Tricks victims into service; prefers feminine form; has "died" and returned multiple times |

### Lesser Demonic Entities

These names have been linked to demonic worship (not True Names):

Namtaru (Plagues), Neberu (Prophet), Rabisu (Vagabond), Halaku (Anguished), Nikanuuranu, Azaneal (Priest, former Baali elevated to demon), Annunaki (Many Faces), Lammasu (Betrayer), Orobas (Glutton), Apep (Serpent), Ba'al (Destroyer), Ba'alat (Nymph), Nergal (Diseased), Moloch (Iron Fist), Beelzebub (Lord of Flies), Shaitan (Deceiver), The Thousand Names, Umvak (Swarm), Shahlieh (Mother of Enigma)

---

## True Names vs. Celestial Names

| Name Type | Description | Power |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Celestial Name** | Common name (Belial, Abbadon) | Attracts attention, pressures response |
| **True Name** | Complex syllabic "verbal DNA strand" | Compels action, even against will |

**Critical**: An incomplete or incorrect True Name causes the summoning to end disastrously.

---

## Summoning Demons

### The Ritual of Summoning

This ritual is NOT thaumaturgical — anyone (mortal or Kindred) can perform it.

**Requirements**:
- Celestial Name or True Name of demon
- Lengthy calculations and mystical rites (can take months)
- Intelligence + Demonology extended roll (one roll per week)
- Accumulate successes equal to demon's Willpower

**Success**: Demon appears in binding circle as spiritual being (pillar of fire, ethereal monstrosity, reflection of caster's face, sulfurous smoke, image of someone from past). Once satisfied it cannot escape, takes physical form to bargain.

**Failure**: Normal failure = nothing happens. **Botch** = catastrophic results (instant death, demon summoned but unbound, plagues, curses, release of evil souls).

**Bound Demon**: Must obey requests TO THE LETTER for one day — but may twist wording to its own ends.

### Demon Manifestation

Demons in the physical world have limited duration:

| Binding Method | Duration | Notes |
|----------------|----------|-------|
| Unbound | Hours | Returns to Hell quickly |
| Mortal host | 2-3 days | Body burns out, destroyed |
| Vampire host | Uncomfortable | Blood of Caine seethes with holy poison; demons avoid this |
| Talisman | Near-permanent | Until talisman destroyed |
| Location | Near-permanent | Requires massive blasphemous ritual; most powerful binding |

---

## Types of Bargains

### 1. Arrangements (Verbal Deals)
- Simple verbal agreements
- Either side may wriggle out if willing to face the other's wrath
- No soul exchange
- Low-level favors

### 2. Empowerments (Single Exchange)
- Usually signed in blood or sworn by oath
- One-time exchange: portion of soul for one Investment or reality alteration
- Cannot be broken by either side
- Demon gains permanent connection: can contact, visit, or perceive through thrall's senses

### 3. Foedus (True Pact)
- Dedication of entire soul
- Usually involves worship of an Archduke
- Ongoing partnership with continuous obligations
- May include forbiddances (can't step on holy ground, speak Christ's name)
- May include active service (sacrifice, conversion, repeated offerings)
- Source of Dark Thaumaturgy
- **Breaking a Foedus**: Demon rises and devours thrall; no powers or weapons wielded by thrall can harm the demon

---

## Thralldom and Corruption

Once ANY bargain is made, the individual is marked as a thrall:

**Immediate Effects**:
- Demon can contact, sense location, or perceive through senses at any time
- Soul bears invisible sigil of demonic master
- Sigil becomes visible when using infernal powers (detectable by Auspex, mystic senses, Awareness)
- Even non-sensitive mortals feel chills when thrall uses powers

**Progressive Corruption**:
- Every vice begins to overflow
- Urges become harder to resist
- Each succumbing corrupts soul further
- Vampires: Beast grows stronger, Humanity fails
- Only way to maintain control: feed the demon someone else instead

**Detection**:
- Normally invisible to aura reading
- Visible when using infernal powers
- May be detected by Karmic Sight (Auspex 6) even when dormant

---

## New Ability: Demonology (Expert Knowledge)

**Description**: Knowledge of demonic secrets and summoning. Occult and Theology cover theoretical/esoteric knowledge; Demonology covers practical application.

**Availability**: Catholic Church and Sabbat Inquisition restrict this knowledge. Demons and thralls actively spread it (Internet, college libraries, nightclub bathroom walls — always censored/partial versions).

**Uses**:
- Summoning rituals (Intelligence + Demonology)
- Identifying demonic entities
- Understanding pact terms
- Recognizing infernal corruption

---

## Demonic Investments

Singular bargains made with demons. Cost: 3 XP each, requires separate compact. Characters cannot have more Investments than their Willpower.

**Requirement**: Each Investment requires an overtly evil act specified by the demon. Always requires a Humanity roll.

### Investment List

| Investment | Cost | Effect |
|------------|------|--------|
| **Arsenal of the Beast** | 3 XP | Grow bestial weapon (claws, fangs, horns, tail, tentacles, etc.). Str+2L damage; spend Willpower for aggravated damage for scene. May purchase multiple times for different weapons. |
| **Contagion** | 3 XP | Touch + Willpower: give subtle infectious disease. 3-5 bashing/day until death/torpor. Can cure own diseases. |
| **Degraded Restraint** | 3 XP | Touch + Willpower: target loses 1 Self-Control/Instinct for scene. |
| **Enmity Purge** | 3 XP | Touch + 1 blood: dredge up bigotry, racism, sadism. Self-Control/Instinct (diff 6) or act on worst impulses for the night. |
| **Essence to Ash** | 3 XP | Spend permanent Willpower to heal 2 aggravated. Last resort only. |
| **Insidious Whispers** | 3 XP | Touch + 2 blood (or 2L for mortals): infect subconscious. Conscience (diff 6) or see fears in everything for (infernalist's Willpower) days. |
| **Penance of the Damned** | 3 XP | Eye contact + 1 blood: Conviction (diff 6) or relive worst memory; all Virtues fall to 1 for one hour. |
| **Telepathic Worm** | 3 XP | 1 Willpower: mental tentacle lies dormant. Triggers when target sees, names, or contacts specific person — psychic pain (Wits + Intimidation, bypasses Fortitude, damages Willpower). Lasts one lunar cycle. |

---

## Dark Thaumaturgy

Blood magic powered by demonic patrons. Requires a Foedus — the vampire calls out and the demon allows use of its infernal energy.

### Path of Phobos

Tap into victims' psyches, making fears appear real. Sabbat infernalists prefer this for its "sublime effects."

**Side Effect**: Using more than once per story requires Manipulation + Empathy (diff 7). Failure = relive victims' nightmares; wake soaked in blood (extra blood point to rise). Duration based on successes.

| Level | Power | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|
| • | **Induce Fear** | Line of sight, gesture, chant. Victim becomes paranoid, shapes at vision's edge. Courage (diff 4 + successes, max 9) to act. -1 to all pools. Duration: 1 turn/5 turns/1 hour/1 night/2 nights by successes. |
| •• | **Spook** | See victim, whisper prayer. Suspicion becomes dread. Mortals: Courage (diff 7) or flee. Vampires: same, or Rötschreck on failure. |
| ••• | **Terrorize** | Concentrate, gesture. Victim sees worst fear (spiders, fire, etc.). Courage (diff 7) to act or cower. Botch = derangement. Duration: 1 turn/5 turns/30 min/1 hour/1 night. |
| •••• | **Fear Plague** | See and loudly curse. For one week, victim harassed by fear constantly. All Willpower rolls treat permanent rating as 3 lower (min 1). |
| ••••• | **Leech of Fear** | Line of sight to frightened victim (not from this path). Convert fear to "fear pool" points = successes. Spend like blood points, beyond Generation limits. Must use before sunrise. |

### The Taking of the Spirit

Strip away Willpower, leaving automatons ready to serve. Works on vampires and mortals.

**System**: Loudly call Hell's legions, touch target (may require Dex + Brawl). Contested Willpower (diff 8). Success = victim loses Willpower equal to infernalist's successes.

**If victim accumulates more successes first**: Resists; this path cannot be used against them for one year.

**If victim reaches 0 Willpower**: Zombie-like state, does infernalist's bidding until regaining 1 Willpower.

**Willpower Recovery** (based on path rating):

| Path Rating | Recovery Rate |
|-------------|---------------|
| • | 3 points/day's rest |
| •• | 2 points/day's rest |
| ••• | 1 point/day's rest |
| •••• | 1 point/week's rest |
| ••••• | 1 point/two weeks' rest |

**If infernalist dies**: Victim regains all Willpower immediately.

**Botch**: Infernalist loses temporary Willpower equal to path rating. Returns 1/night. If all lost, may come under control of otherworldly forces.

### The Fires of the Inferno

Summon balefire — malignant green flame from Hell. Being burned tastes of Hell's agonies. Anyone with mystic senses knows the source is infernal.

**System**: Successes determine placement accuracy. Fire under caster's control doesn't harm them or cause frenzy, but fires STARTED by the balefire affect caster normally.

| Level | Fire Size | Soak Diff | Damage/Turn |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| • | Lighter | 3 | 1 health |
| •• | Stovetop | 4 | 2 health |
| ••• | Blowtorch | 5 | 3 health |
| •••• | Flame-thrower | 7 | 4 health |
| ••••• | Conflagration | 9 | 5 health |

**Note**: Must have Fortitude to soak at all.

## The Baali

Ancient bloodline devoted to infernal worship since before Carthage.

### Origins
- Mystery cult in Ashur (modern Iraq) performed human sacrifices into a deep well
- Powerful vampire discovered them, hurled priests and victims in, drained blood over them
- Three emerged: the first Baali
- Shaitan built fortress around the well, swore bloodline to infernal service

### Chorazin, the Damned City
- Hidden valley somewhere in Middle East (Sea of Galilee? Damascus? Mecca?)
- Black basalt ruins protected by ancient infernal magic
- Thousands of souls bound into stone walls
- Two demons reside within: **Azaneal** and **Namtaru**
- Sun turns black so vampires can worship during day
- Can only be found by powerful sorcerers or those who sold their souls for the knowledge

### The Veneficti (Circle of Red)
- Mortal mages nearly eradicated by Baali
- Survivors swore eternal loyalty in exchange for existence
- Now lich-like semi-immortals, feeding on will like ghouls feed on blood
- Physically twisted, laden with permanent Investments
- Guard Chorazin's libraries
- Possess five of six volumes of the *Voleurs d'Enfer*; seek the sixth

### Secrets of the Eldest
- Ancient Baali elders sleep in iron casks on defiled earth that steams with Hell's heat
- Hoard True Names never spoken, truths about pre-Flood era, secrets of Carthage
- One elder supposedly knows how to permanently kill an Archduke
