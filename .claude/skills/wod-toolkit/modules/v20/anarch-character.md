# Anarch Character Creation Module

Create Anarchs—vampires who reject the rigid hierarchies of the Camarilla and Sabbat in favor of freedom, egalitarianism, and self-determination.

---

## Overview

Anarchs range from leather-clad rabble to wily hackers, from idealistic revolutionaries to opportunistic gangbangers. What unites them is rejection of elder tyranny and belief that the Jyhad's inequities must be challenged.

**Core Theme**: The hypocrisy of change—Anarchs overthrow tyrants only to risk becoming tyrants themselves.

**Core Mood**: Anticipation and suspicion. Always on the verge of the next change. Stasis equals becoming what they hate.

## Step 6: Morality

### Humanity vs. Paths

Most Anarchs follow Humanity—it's part of their closer relationship with mortals and rejection of elder inhumanity. However:

**Path Followers Exist**:
- Former Sabbat escapees retaining their Paths
- Deep-cover Anarchs in Sabbat territory
- Exotic origins with alien philosophies

**Path Followers Face Challenges**:
- No sect structure supporting Path study
- Must learn by trial and error
- Come across as alien and cold to other Anarchs
- May be willing to share info with fellow Path followers

### The Anarch Morality Dilemma

Anarchs must reconcile:
- Hatred of elder oppression vs. keeping ghouls in servitude
- Political optimism vs. necessary violence
- Egalitarian ideals vs. the reality that vampires are predators
- Revolutionary fervor vs. risk of becoming what they overthrew
