# Ghoul Organizations Module

Create and reference ghoul organizations — groups of ghouls operating independently or semi-independently of individual domitors.

---

## Overview

Ghoul organizations exist in secret, often targeted by both Camarilla (Masquerade concerns) and Sabbat (escaped servants). Membership is scrutinized due to infiltration attempts by bound ghouls.

## Creating Organization Members

### Character Considerations
When creating a ghoul belonging to an organization:

1. **Motivation**: Why join? Escape, ideology, survival, profit?
2. **Recruitment**: How discovered? Approached or sought out?
3. **Role**: Combat, research, support, leadership?
4. **Loyalty**: To organization, self, or former master?
5. **Secrets**: What do they hide from fellow members?

## Storytelling Notes

### Using Organizations in Chronicles
- Independent ghoul PCs may belong to organizations
- Organizations can be allies, enemies, or sources of missions
- Infiltration attempts create dramatic tension
- Cell structure allows localized stories

### Organization Conflicts
- AHS vs. Tremere (stolen secrets)
- Unmastered vs. Sabbat (liberation missions)
- Talons vs. Camarilla (elite strikes)
- Sacrament vs. Modern Clans (ideological)
- Sanguinaries vs. Everyone (competition for vitae)

### Crossover Potential
- Revenant families may interact with organizations
- Vampires may hire organization members
- Hunter groups may share targets with some organizations
