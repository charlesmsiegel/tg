# Thaumaturgy Module

## Overview
Creates Thaumaturgy paths, rituals, and blood magic practitioners. Thaumaturgy is the signature Discipline of Clan Tremere—a system of blood magic with multiple paths and rituals.

## How Thaumaturgy Works

### Paths vs. Rituals
- **Paths**: Active powers bought like Disciplines (1-5 dots)
- **Rituals**: Learned separately, rated by level (1-5)
- Every Thaumaturge has one **Primary Path**
- Additional paths cost more XP than primary
- Ritual levels ≤ highest path rating

### System Basics
- Most path powers cost 1 Blood Point
- Roll Willpower (difficulty varies by power)
- Rituals have specific casting times and components

Starting character typically knows 1-3 rituals.

### Step 5: Occult Rating
Thaumaturges need Occult for research and understanding.

## Blood Magic Principles (Rites of the Blood)

All blood magic operates on these foundational principles:

| Principle | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Blood** | Vitae fuels all blood magic |
| **Will** | Force of will shapes the magic |
| **Knowledge** | Understanding limits power—no secondary path can exceed primary until mastered |
| **Identity** | Level of connection determines targeting |
| **Contagion** | Things once connected retain links |
| **Sympathy** | Like produces like |

### Sympathetic Magic Difficulty Modifiers

When targeting at distance through rituals:

| Modifier | Connection |
|----------|------------|
| -1 | Target's blood or body part |
| 0 | Hair, nail, bodily fluid, magical item |
| +1 | Prized possession |
| +2 | Recently handled object, fingerprint, relative's blood |
| +3 | Object handled once recently |
| +4 | Recent picture |
| +5 | Name written on paper |

**Note**: No combination can raise difficulty above 9 or below 4.
