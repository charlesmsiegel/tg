# Free State Creation Module

Create Anarch domains—Free States, Baronies, and revolutionary territories where vampires govern themselves outside traditional sect hierarchy.

---

## Overview

An Anarch Free State is a domain where the Movement has established praxis, free from Camarilla Princes or Sabbat Archbishops. These range from utopian experiments in vampire democracy to criminal fiefdoms where Barons rule as ruthlessly as any Prince.

**Core Paradox**: The revolution often replaces one tyrant with another. True egalitarianism is the exception, not the rule.

---

## Step 1: Domain Origins

### How Was the Free State Established?

| Origin | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Revolutionary Coup** | Overthrew previous Prince/Archbishop. Defined by what it opposes. |
| **Gradual Erosion** | Camarilla/Sabbat control weakened over time until Anarchs filled the vacuum. |
| **Virgin Territory** | Claimed before other sects established presence. |
| **Negotiated Independence** | Bargained freedom from sect (rare). |
| **Geographic Isolation** | Too remote for other sects to bother controlling. |
| **Post-Catastrophe** | Rose from ashes of domain-destroying event. |

### When Was It Founded?

| Era | Implications |
|-----|--------------|
| **Ancient** (pre-1493) | Predates Convention of Thorns. Deep history. |
| **Post-Revolt** (1493-1900) | Born from original Anarch Revolt wave. |
| **Modern** (1900-1990) | Product of 20th century upheavals. |
| **Contemporary** (1990-present) | Internet age domain. Tech-savvy. |

### Domain Anniversary

**La Libertad**: Most Free States celebrate their founding anniversary. Often includes:
- Swearing-in of new citizens
- Rewards for brave exploits
- Public rituals affirming domain values

## Step 2: Government Structure

### Leadership Models

| Model | Description | Stability |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Barony** | Single Baron with near-absolute power | High (if Baron is strong) |
| **Council of Barons** | Multiple Barons share power geographically | Medium |
| **Parliamentary Democracy** | Elected Chancellors, factions compete | Low-Medium |
| **Direct Democracy** | All citizens vote on all matters | Low |
| **Rotating Leadership** | Leadership changes on schedule | Medium |
| **Anarchic** | No formal leadership at all | Very Low |
| **Corporatist Commune** | Vitae as collectively-owned capital | Medium |

### Anarch Titles and Roles

| Title | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **Baron** | Domain leader (autocratic or elected) |
| **Chancellor** | Executive in parliamentary systems |
| **President** | Executive in separation-of-powers democracy |
| **Reeve** | Law enforcement chief (less summary power than Sheriff—needs warrants) |
| **Legate** | Agent sent to allied domains (also called Cheka) |
| **Citizen** | Full member with voting rights |

### Compact System (Frankpledge)

Some domains use the Compact—randomly assigned groups who stand collective surety for each other:
- Used to integrate rival factions
- Creates pressure for conformity
- Forces strangers to cooperate
- Can feel oppressive to newcomers

---

## Step 3: Laws and Traditions

### The Traditions in Anarch Domains

Most Free States still observe the Traditions, but interpret them differently:

| Tradition | Anarch Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Masquerade** | Nearly universal. Breach endangers everyone. |
| **Domain** | Recognized by consensus, not decree. May be shared. |
| **Progeny** | Usually limited (overpopulation threatens Masquerade) but process more democratic. |
| **Accounting** | May be shared across Compact rather than sire alone. |
| **Hospitality** | More open than Camarilla, but immigration may require approval. |
| **Destruction** | Only by consensus or in self-defense. No Prince's whim. |

### Common Anarch Laws

| Law | Variation |
|-----|-----------|
| **No Blood Bonds** | Some domains ban bonds entirely |
| **Democratic Siring** | Committee approves new Embraces |
| **Shared Hunting** | Territories assigned or open |
| **Transparency** | Leaders must answer to citizens |
| **Term Limits** | For elected positions |
| **Right of Departure** | Can leave with your share |

### Justice System

| System | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Trial by Peers** | Jury of citizens judges offenses |
| **Reeve Investigation** | Reeve gathers evidence, presents to council |
| **Baron's Judgment** | Baron decides (may be appealed) |
| **Mob Rule** | Citizens take matters into own hands |
| **Compact Responsibility** | Your Compact pays for your crimes |

---

## Step 4: Internal Factions

### Ideological Camps

| Faction | Beliefs |
|---------|---------|
| **Idealists** | True egalitarianism, moral high ground, risk ineffectiveness |
| **Realists** | Pragmatic compromise, functional government, risk becoming what they oppose |
| **Radicals** | Revolution must go further, current leadership too soft |
| **Traditionalists** | Founding principles being abandoned, push back against change |

### The Intelligentsia

Some domains have an intellectual faction:
- Philosophers and thinkers
- Create and distribute ideas
- May be secret patrons
- Can subvert expectations

### The Loyal Opposition

Every domain has dissenters:
- Think Anarchs aren't "Anarch enough"
- Or think idealism is unrealistic
- Serve as counterbalance
- May be exploited by outsiders

---

## Step 5: External Relations

### With the Camarilla

| Relationship | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| **Open War** | Active conflict with neighboring Princes |
| **Cold War** | Tension without direct fighting |
| **Détente** | Grudging mutual recognition |
| **Infiltrated** | Camarilla agents embedded in domain |
| **Infiltrating** | Anarch agents in Camarilla territory |

### With the Sabbat

| Relationship | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| **Under Siege** | Sabbat Crusade targeting domain |
| **Buffer Zone** | Between Camarilla and Sabbat territory |
| **Former Sabbat** | Domain was taken from Sabbat |
| **Hidden** | Sabbat doesn't know domain exists |

### With Other Anarchs

| Relationship | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| **Allied** | Mutual defense, shared resources |
| **Federated** | Formal alliance with joint institutions |
| **Rival** | Competition for resources, refugees |
| **Isolated** | No contact with other Free States |

### Legates and Molotovs

**Legates**: Official agents sent to allied domains for liaison, intelligence, and influence.

**Molotovs**: Deniable agents provocateur who harass enemy domains to force negotiations.

---

## Step 6: Economy and Resources

### Feeding

| System | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Open Hunting** | Hunt where you will (risky) |
| **Assigned Territories** | Each Kindred/coterie has area |
| **Communal Herd** | Shared blood dolls, club scene |
| **Rotation** | Hunting rights cycle through population |

### Income Sources

| Source | Legality |
|--------|----------|
| **Criminal Enterprise** | Drugs, guns, prostitution |
| **Protection Rackets** | Classic gang revenue |
| **Tech Startups** | Silicon Valley Anarchs |
| **Legitimate Business** | Clubs, bars, real estate |
| **Communal Pool** | Shared resources |

### Territory Control

| Method | Risk |
|--------|------|
| **Mortal Gangs** | Ghouls and allies control streets |
| **Business Fronts** | Economic leverage |
| **Political Influence** | Control through officials |
| **Digital Presence** | Hacktivist surveillance and manipulation |

---

## Step 7: Notable Locations

### Required Locations

| Location | Function |
|----------|----------|
| **Meeting Hall** | Where citizens gather (Rant, council, etc.) |
| **Communal Haven(s)** | Shared sleeping space for those without personal havens |
| **Emergency Refuge** | Bolt-hole for domain-wide threats |

### Optional Locations

| Location | Function |

| **Server Farm** | Hacktivist operations |

---

## Step 8: Domain Dynamics

### Stability Factors

| Factor | Stabilizing | Destabilizing |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Leadership** | Strong Baron or functional democracy | Power vacuum, factional fighting |
| **External Threat** | Unites against common enemy | No threat allows infighting |
| **Resources** | Sufficient hunting, territory | Scarcity breeds conflict |
| **Ideology** | Shared principles | Ideological purity tests |
| **History** | Tradition of cooperation | Legacy of betrayal |

### The Revolutionary Cycle

Anarch domains tend to follow a pattern:

1. **Revolution**: Overthrow tyranny in burst of idealism
2. **Radicalization**: Revolution becomes more extreme
3. **Reaction**: Stabilizing force emerges (new Baron)
4. **Institutionalization**: Rules solidify, idealism fades
5. **Stagnation**: New system becomes what it replaced
6. **Revolution**: Cycle begins again

## Example Free State Concepts

### The Last Bastion
Small Free State surrounded by Camarilla territory. Survives through constant vigilance and exploiting Princes' rivalries. Paranoid but united.

### The Experiment
Utopian direct democracy where every citizen has equal voice. Beautiful in theory, chaotic in practice. Idealists versus realists in constant tension.

### The Barony
Baron rules with iron fist—better than the Prince, but not by much. Citizens grumble but remember what came before. Revolution brewing.

### The Collective
Tech-focused domain built on Hacktivist foundations. SchreckNet hub. Wealth from Silicon Valley. Out of touch with traditional Anarchs.

### The Refuge
Safe haven for escapees from Sabbat. Traumatized population. PTSD and Path confusion. Constant fear of Sabbat retrieval teams.

### The Deadlock
Two rival Barons in uneasy power-sharing. Neither strong enough to defeat the other. Every decision is a negotiation. Citizens play both sides.
