# Necromancy Module

## Overview
Creates Necromancy paths, rituals, and practitioners. Necromancy is the signature Discipline of Clan Giovanni—death magic dealing with ghosts, corpses, and the Underworld.

## How Necromancy Works

### Paths vs. Rituals
- **Paths**: Active powers bought like Disciplines (1-5 dots)
- **Rituals**: Learned separately, rated by level (1-5)
- Every Necromancer has one **Primary Path** (usually Sepulchre Path)
- Ritual levels ≤ highest path rating
- All Necromancy involves the dead in some form

### System Basics
- Path powers typically cost 1 Blood Point
- Roll Intelligence + Occult (difficulty varies)
- Rituals require specific components (often morbid)
- Wraiths can resist with Willpower

Select rituals ≤ highest path level.
Giovanni characters often start with 2-4 rituals.

### Step 5: Relevant Backgrounds
- **Wraith contacts**: Allies or Contacts among the dead
- **Occult library**: Necromantic research materials
- **Cemetery access**: Corpses and ritual space

## The Underworld Basics

### The Shadowlands
- Parallel world of the dead
- Overlaps with living world
- Wraiths trapped here by Fetters
- Separated by the Shroud

### The Shroud
- Barrier between living and dead worlds
- Varies in strength by location
- Hospitals, cemeteries: thin Shroud
- Churches, happy homes: thick Shroud
- Necromancy can manipulate Shroud

### Wraiths
- Ghosts of the dead
- Anchored by Fetters (objects, places, people)
- Have own powers (Arcanoi)
- Can be bound, commanded, or destroyed
- Have Shadow (dark side that wants Oblivion)

### Fetters
- Connections to living world
- Objects, locations, or living people
- Destroying Fetters weakens/destroys wraith
- Necromancers can identify and exploit these
