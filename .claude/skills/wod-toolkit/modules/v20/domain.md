# Domain Creation Module

## Overview
Creates domains—territories claimed and controlled by vampires. Includes hunting grounds, havens, and political boundaries.

## Domain Types

### By Scale
- **Personal Domain**: Single vampire's claimed territory
- **Coterie Domain**: Shared territory of a group
- **Primogen Domain**: Clan territory within a city
- **Prince's Domain**: Entire city under one ruler
- **Barony**: Anarch-controlled territory
- **Diocese**: Sabbat-controlled region

### By Function
- **Feeding Ground**: Primary purpose is hunting
- **Power Base**: Center of political influence
- **Refuge**: Hidden from sect politics
- **Commercial**: Generates Resources
- **Cultural**: Elysium, gathering places

## Creation Steps

### Step 1: Location & Boundaries
Define the physical territory:
- Neighborhood, district, or specific locations
- Clear boundaries (streets, landmarks, natural features)
- Size relative to city (use Domain Background rating)

| Rating | Size | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| 1 | Building/small area | Nightclub, apartment building |
| 2 | City block | Bar district, small park |
| 3 | Neighborhood | Arts district, university campus |
| 4 | District | Downtown, industrial zone |
| 5 | Multiple districts | Half the city |

### Step 2: Mortal Population

**Density**:
- Sparse (suburbs, industrial)
- Moderate (residential, commercial)
- Dense (downtown, entertainment)

**Character**:
- Working class, professional, wealthy, mixed
- Transient vs. established residents
- Criminal presence
- Nightlife activity

**Feeding Quality**:
- Rich blood (healthy, young) vs. compromised
- Ease of hunting (crowds vs. isolation)
- Risk of notice

### Step 3: Supernatural Presence

**Other Kindred**:
- Who else hunts here? (with or without permission)
- Neighboring domains and relations
- Poachers and interlopers

**Other Supernaturals**:
- Werewolf territories nearby?
- Mage sanctums?
- Ghost activity?
- Other threats?

### Step 4: Mortal Power Structures
Who controls the mortal side?
- Police presence and corruption
- Criminal organizations
- Local politics
- Business interests
- Media coverage

### Step 5: Assets & Resources

**Physical Assets**:
- Havens within domain
- Business properties
- Safe houses
- Meeting locations

**Influence Assets**:
- Police/security contacts
- Political connections
- Business ownership
- Media access
- Criminal ties

**Feeding Infrastructure**:
- Established herd
- Regular hunting spots
- Blood supply alternatives

### Step 6: Security & Defense

**Physical Security**:
- Patrol routes
- Alarm systems
- Guard ghouls/retainers
- Safe rooms

**Information Security**:
- Surveillance networks
- Informant networks
- Counter-surveillance
- Masquerade maintenance

**Supernatural Defense**:
- Wards (if available)
- Escape routes
- Emergency protocols
- Alliance response

### Step 7: Political Status

**Recognition**:
- Formally granted by Prince/Baron?
- Contested or secure?
- Known to other Kindred?

**Obligations**:
- Tribute to sect leadership?
- Defense responsibilities?
- Hospitality requirements?

## Domain Challenges

### Feeding Competition
- Not enough vessels for all Kindred
- Quality vs. quantity tradeoffs
- Seasonal variations (tourists, students)

### Masquerade Threats
- Investigative journalists
- Police attention
- Hunter activity
- Supernatural incidents

### Political Pressure
- Elder claims historical right
- Primogen disputes territory
- Prince reassigns domains
- Sect conflict (Sabbat/Camarilla border)

### Infrastructure Decay
- Gentrification changing population
- Economic decline reducing resources
- Construction disrupting havens
- Urban renewal projects

## Elysium Domains

Special domains where violence is forbidden:

**Common Elysium Types**:
- Museums (art, culture)
- Theaters and opera houses
- Universities (neutral ground)
- Historical buildings
- Private clubs

**Elysium Rules**:

## Quick Domain Concepts

### The Rack
Prime downtown feeding ground. Dense nightlife, easy hunting, but heavy competition and Masquerade risks. Multiple Kindred share by arrangement.

### The Warren
Industrial district with abandoned buildings. Poor feeding but excellent haven potential. Often claimed by Nosferatu or outcasts.

### The Garden
Wealthy residential area. High-quality vessels but suspicious neighbors. Requires subtle approach and established herd.

### The Campus
University grounds. Transient population (students), predictable patterns, intellectual prey. Often contested neutral ground.

### The Underground
Literal underground—subway tunnels, basements, sewers. Nosferatu territory typically. Poor feeding but nearly impenetrable security.
