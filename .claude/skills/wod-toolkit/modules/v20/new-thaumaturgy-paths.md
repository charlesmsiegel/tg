## Tremere Paths

### Path of the Levinbolt

Control over electricity. Remained obscure until modern times due to lack of understanding of electrical principles. Popularized after John Blackwood's work in the late 19th century.

**Side Effect**: Practitioners cause static electricity, flickering lights, cellular interference, and computer power surges in their presence.

**Touch Powers**: Some powers require touch. May need Dexterity + Brawl to contact unwilling targets.

| Level | Power | System |
|-------|-------|--------|
| • | **Flicker** | Glance at electrical device. Shut it down for 10 min/success. Spark arcs visibly from device to caster. |
| •• | **Spark** | Touch to discharge. 4L damage (diff 7 soak). Shorts out ungrounded electronics. Can discharge from any body part. |
| ••• | **Illuminate** | Cover hand/arm in arcing electricity. Powers small device for 1 turn/success OR 8L touch damage (diff 8 soak). Can spark around hand/eyes/head: -2 difficulty Intimidation. |
| •••• | **Thor's Fury** | Ranged lightning bolt. Perception + Science (diff 6 + range in yards, max 4 yards). 1L/success (diff 8 soak). |
| ••••• | **Eye of the Storm** | Spend Willpower. Become electrical barrier for 1 turn + 1/success. Immune to ranged attacks. Metal weapons: normal first strike, then melt + 1L to wielder. Touch = 2 aggravated (diff 8 soak). Non-metal weapons unaffected. Mental/social attacks pass through. |

### Path of Spirit Manipulation

Replace old Tremere mortal magic with systematic spirit control. Spirits are "Umbrood" — constructs that the limited humanoid brain perceives as spirits.

**Note**: Spirits are not sentient in the traditional sense. They're reflections of the spirit world perceived through limited mortal understanding. This is why Presence works on them (perception-based) but Dominate doesn't (requires true sentience).

| Level | Power | System |
|-------|-------|--------|
| • | **Hermetic Sight** | Perceive spirit realm overlaid on material world. Duration: 1 hour + 30 min/additional success. |
| •• | **Astral Cant** | Understand and speak spirit languages. Duration: 15 min + 15 min/additional success. Many spirits speak human tongues but feign ignorance. |
| ••• | **Voice of Command** | Issue one command to spirit. Spirit's Willpower vs caster's Manipulation + Occult. Command must be single action completable in one turn. |
| •••• | **Entrap Ephemera** | Bind spirit into prepared physical vessel. Extended contest: caster's Willpower vs spirit's. First to 3 net successes wins. Vessel must be appropriate to spirit's nature. |
| ••••• | **Duality** | Temporarily become dual-natured (exist in material and spirit simultaneously). Duration: 1 scene. Can interact with spirits physically. Vulnerable to spirit attacks. |

## Blood Magic Principles

### The Four Foundational Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Blood** | Blood fuels all magic. Point expenditure powers effects. |
| **Will** | Willpower shapes and directs magical energy. |
| **Knowledge** | Understanding limits and enables power. Primary path informs all others. |
| **Identity** | Targeting requires connection to subject. |

### Sympathetic Magic Modifiers

For rituals targeting distant subjects without specified requirements:

| Difficulty Modifier | Sample Connection |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| -1 | Blood point or severed body part (finger+) |
| 0 | Lock of hair, fingernail, bodily fluid, magical item created by target |
| +1 | Prized possession |
| +2 | Owned/handled item within 1 week, fingerprint, blood/part from blood relative |
| +3 | Item handled once in last week |
| +4 | Recent picture |
| +5 | Name written on paper |

**Limits**: No combination can raise difficulty above 9 or lower below 4. If modifier would exceed 9, ritual cannot succeed with that connection.
