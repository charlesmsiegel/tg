## Boon Mechanics

### Establishing Boons
- Agreed upon by both parties
- Formal domains may require Elysium witness
- Harpy or Chancellor may record

### Discharging Boons
- Debt-holder declares satisfied
- May need reporting to Harpy/Chancellor
- Very formal domains require public declaration

### Trading Boons
- Boons circulate like currency
- Affected party must be notified of transfer
- Moving boons signals social hierarchy
- "Katherine owes me, so I'll have her help you if you handle Pavel"

### Optional: Purchasing Boons (XP)
Players may invest XP for "off-camera" favors:
- Trivial: 3 XP
- Minor: 7 XP
- Major: 20 XP
- Life: Cannot be purchased

Work with Storyteller to establish circumstances.

## Consequences

### Cheating on Boons
If boon-holder "forgets" discharge:
- Victim has limited recourse
- But pattern of abuse damages reputation
- "A Kindred is only as good as her word"
- Powers that be may intervene if abuse obvious

### Killing to Escape Debt
Severest consequences:
- Elders hold most boons = most likely targets
- Murder for debt relief = example must be made
- Minimum: Lextalionis or Blood Feast fodder
- Maximum: Unspeakable (rumors circulate to discourage)

### Oathbreakers
- Demonstrate self-interest over community
- "Can't keep promise = can't keep Masquerade"
- Most Cainite leaders prefer final satisfaction
- Treacherous Kindred will betray again

---

## Sect-Specific Prestation

### Camarilla
**Style**: Formal, elaborate, Harpy-tracked

- Most sophisticated prestation system
- Harpies arbitrate validity and satisfaction
- Trading boons common and accepted
- Status heavily tied to boon networks
- Elders accumulate vast networks over centuries
- "Temple of obligation" underlies all society

### Sabbat
**Style**: Pack-level common; higher echelons informal

- Considered "too soft" by many
- "Too much like the Ivory Tower"
- Pack members watch each other's backs naturally
- Inter-pack boons more common
- **Lasombra**: Favor indulgence-style boon trading (aristocratic heritage)
- **Tzimisce**: Find prestation odious; masters grant privilege, not owe it
- **Antitribu**: Necessary evil; learn rules, take advantage
- No formal boon trading between individuals typically

### Anarchs
**Style**: Tech-integrated, blood oaths fashionable

- Torn on formality vs. practicality
- Tech-adept Anarchs use social media tracking
- Code words, hashtags preserve Masquerade
- Online reputation systems (like auction site ratings)
- Blood oaths currently fashionable for solemnity
- As Anarchs become authority, prestation becomes tool of subversion against them

### Tal'Mahe'Ra
**Style**: Replaced by oaths, cults, apprenticeships

- Higher concerns than petty favor-trading
- Status from unearthing secrets, solving mysteries
- Complex fealties and internal secret societies
- Assumes members help each other (fanatical devotion)
- Deep-cover agents cultivate prestation in other sects
- Outside obligations taken seriously for cover

### Inconnu
**Style**: Unknown; possibly written documents

- Only known example: written document invoking Christ's judgment
- "The power of Christ shall strike me dead should I stray"
- Whether florid phrasing or expected outcome unknown
- Recipient "Dondinni" may still exist

### Independents

**Assamites**: 
- Rarely use prestation
- Prefer contracts: cash and vitae
- May use to establish long-term domain presence
- Growing intimacy with Camarilla increases use

**Giovanni**:
- No trouble with prestation system
- Offer "exchange rates" for boons
- Buy favors for liquid resources
- Elders wary of Necromancers cornering market

**Ravnos**:
- Casual, unreliable honor conventions
- Often on receiving end of screw-jobs
- Second-class status in other sects' domains

**Setites**:
- Difficulty invoking prestation
- Prefer payment on own terms
- Blood mastery over formal agreements
- Second-class status in other sects' domains

---

## Inter-Sect Prestation

### Cross-Sect Boons
- Observed because enlightened self-interest
- Rogue who breaks promise to one may break promise to you
- "A rogue is a rogue regardless of sect"

### Complications
- Hardliners question loyalty
- May lose Status or titles for "outside" dealing
- May need to tithe vitae, accept blood bonds
- Or operate behind sect's back
- Liberal domains may pave way for others

### Most Difficult Relations
- **Camarilla ↔ Sabbat**: Diametrically opposed
- **Camarilla ↔ Anarchs**: Success of one hinders other

### Clan Unity
Sometimes clan > sect:
- Nosferatu information network ignores ideology
- Gangrel, Malkavian, Brujah may close ranks
- Disenfranchised clans value Blood over sect

## Tracking Prestation

### Simple Method
Maintain boon ledger per character:
```
## [Character Name] Boon Ledger

### Owed TO Character
| Debtor | Type | Circumstances | Date |
|--------|------|---------------|------|
| [Name] | Minor | Provided haven during hunt | [Date] |

### Owed BY Character
| Creditor | Type | Circumstances | Date |
|----------|------|---------------|------|
| [Name] | Major | Spoke against enemy at Primogen | [Date] |
```

### Domain Method
Harpy/Chancellor maintains master ledger.

### Anarch Method
Hashtags, code words, online tracking.
- #owed, #paid, #square
- Reputation visible to those who know where to look

---

## Character Integration

### At Character Creation
- May purchase boons with XP (Storyteller approval)
- Establish 1-3 existing relationships
- Document circumstances

### Background Expansion
When expanding Allies/Contacts/Mentor:
- Note any boons owed or held
- Establish prestation relationship
- Consider how debts affect interaction

### Coterie Boons
- Coteries may hold/owe collectively
- Shared responsibility strengthens group
- Internal tracking prevents disputes

---

## Verification Methods

For heavy-handed domains:
- **Dominate**: Ascertain truth of discharge
- **Tremere Rituals**: Extract lies
- **Sabbat Ritae**: Similar effects
- **Tal'Mahe'Ra Witchcraft**: Varied methods
- **Anarch**: Good old-fashioned torture (higher error rate)
