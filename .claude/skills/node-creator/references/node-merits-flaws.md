## Flaws (Negative Ratings)

| Flaw | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Corrupted** | -4 | Warped by Nephandi, Marauders, etc. **Automatically gains "Corrupted 2" Resonance.** Tass is twisted. Using without cleansing implies complicity. |

| **Former Caern/Freehold/Haunt** | -2 | Was once a supernatural location. Previous owners (werewolves/changelings/wraiths) want it back. |
| **Infamous Node** | -1 to -5 | Negative reputation among mages. Functions like Infamy flaw. Should not exceed Node Rank. |
| **Isolated Node** | -2 | No Ley Lines; extremely difficult to lay new ones. Everything using Quintessence must be physically at the Node. |
| **Shallowing (Flaw)** | -2 | Thin Gauntlet passage to Umbra. **Flaw when** Umbral reflection is hostile to owners. Major security risk. |

## Combination Notes

- **Functioning + Former**: If both present for same type, the enemy IS the former owners
- **Famous/Infamous**: Cannot have both for same reputation
- **Shallowing**: Merit OR Flaw, not both—depends on Umbral disposition
- **Corrupted + Sphere Attuned**: Both add to Resonance requirement
