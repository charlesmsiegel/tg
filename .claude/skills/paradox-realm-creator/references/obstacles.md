## Designing Custom Obstacles

When creating obstacles:

1. **Match the Sphere**: Obstacle should clearly relate to Sphere's domain
2. **Challenge, don't kill**: Difficult but survivable
3. **Multiple solutions**: Combat, wit, magic, or acceptance
4. **Personal relevance**: Connect to mage's history or fears
5. **Escalate**: Later obstacles harder than earlier ones

## Combining Obstacles

For severe Paradox, obstacles may combine:
- **Layered**: Must solve in sequence
- **Simultaneous**: Multiple challenges at once
- **Conditional**: One activates another
- **Competitive**: Obstacles work against each other
