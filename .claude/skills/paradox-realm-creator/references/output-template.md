# The Clockwork Purgatory

**Primary Sphere:** Time | **Paradigm:** Mechanistic Cosmos | **Severity:** Severe

## Concept

Created when a Virtual Adept repeatedly rewound time to "fix" failed hacking attempts, this realm manifests as an infinite clockwork mechanism where every gear represents a moment the mage stole. The air smells of oil and burnt circuits. Time moves in stuttering jumps—seconds stretch, then snap forward. The mage feels the weight of every borrowed moment as physical pressure on their chest.

## Statistics

| Stat | Value |

| **Primary Sphere** | Time |
| **Secondary Sphere** | Correspondence |
| **Paradigm Logic** | Mechanistic Cosmos |
| **Severity** | Severe |
| **Primary Obstacles** | 3 |
| **Random Obstacles** | 2 |
| **Final Obstacle** | Solve Riddle |

## Atmosphere

Brass gears the size of buildings grind overhead. The floor is a moving conveyor of interlocking cogs. Clocks of every design line the walls—all showing different times, all ticking out of sync. The sound is maddening: tick-tick-tick-TICK-tick from a thousand sources. Temperature fluctuates as time stutters—freezing in slow moments, burning in fast ones.

## Obstacles

### Primary Obstacles

| # | Name | Description | Challenge |
|---|------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | The Loop Gear | A 10-minute loop that resets everything | Change something the mechanism doesn't expect |
| 2 | Aging Corridor | Walking ages you rapidly | Move at exactly the right speed |
| 3 | Parallel Selves | Meet versions from stolen timelines | Convince them to let you pass |

### Random Obstacles

| # | Sphere | Name | Description | Challenge |
|---|--------|------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Correspondence | Shifting Clockface | Exits move when approached | Map by sound, not sight |
| 2 | Mind | Memory Gears | Memories literally fall out as gears | Catch the important ones |

### Final Obstacle

**Type:** Solve Riddle

**Description:** At the center of the mechanism stands a great clock with no hands. Its face displays not numbers but moments from the mage's life—specifically, every time they used Time magic. The clock speaks in the mage's own voice.

**Escape Condition:** The mage must answer: "What time can never be taken back?" The answer is personal—it must be a specific moment from their life they regret stealing or manipulating. Admitting this winds the clock, which opens a door.

## Recurring Motifs

- Ticking sounds that match heartbeat, then desync
- Reflections show the mage at different ages
- The smell of burning circuits intensifies near obstacles
- Gears occasionally jam, creating pockets of frozen time

## Potential Twists

- The parallel selves aren't hostile—they're warning the mage
- The mechanism is building something from the stolen time
- Each obstacle solved makes the final riddle answer clearer

## Consequences of Failure

**Obstacle Failure:** The mage ages 1 year per failure. Mundane aging, no magic can reverse it while in the realm.

**Extended Imprisonment:** After a week, the mage begins to see their own future—always dying in this place. Willpower roll (diff 8) daily or gain temporary derangement.

**Death:** If the mage dies, their pattern becomes part of the mechanism—a cautionary ghost for the next Time-abuser.

## Story Hooks

- The mage's cabal might enter to rescue them, facing the same obstacles
- Escaping leaves a scar—the mage now hears ticking when about to make a Time-related mistake
- The parallel selves might escape too, causing timeline complications
