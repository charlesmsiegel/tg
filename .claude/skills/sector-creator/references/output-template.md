# The Phantom Exchange

**Class:** Grid | **Access:** Restricted | **Security:** 7

## Concept

A black market data haven built in the shell of a crashed financial trading system. The Phantom Exchange serves as neutral ground for information brokers, rogue AIs, and mages who need to buy or sell data without questions. The original trading algorithms still run in the background, creating a constant ticker-tape atmosphere of scrolling numbers and fluctuating values. Everything here has a price—including safe passage.

## Visual Description

The Exchange manifests as an endless trading floor from the 1980s rendered in neon wireframe. Columns of green numbers scroll upward on every surface. Floating screens display goods for sale—data packets, access codes, stolen memories, viral weapons. The "floor" is a grid of glowing lines over black void. Trader icons cluster around auction blocks that pulse with activity.

## Navigation

The Exchange is divided into specialized zones connected by "trading lanes"—highways of flowing data. Movement between zones requires either walking the lanes (slow, exposed) or purchasing a "fast pass" from local vendors (expensive, tracked).

**Zones:**
- **The Pit**: Main trading floor, neutral ground
- **The Vaults**: Secure storage rentals
- **The Back Room**: Illegal goods, higher security
- **The Exits**: Conduits out, monitored

## Connected Sectors

| Sector | Direction | Access |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| The Public Grid | Main Exit | Free (one-way from Exchange) |
| Syndicate Subnet | Back Room portal | Syndicate credentials |
| The Junklands | Maintenance hatch | Hidden, unguarded |
| Unknown Deep Sector | Rumored | ??? |

## Hazards

### IC Programs

| IC Type | Trigger | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Trace | Unauthorized access | Logs identity, alerts Broker |
| Tar Pit | Theft attempt | Slows to crawl, summons guards |
| Ripper | Violence in neutral zones | 4L damage, marks attacker |
| Binder | Debt default | Immobilizes until payment |

### Other Hazards

- **Scammers**: Not everyone deals honestly
- **Syndicate Agents**: Watching for specific data
- **Viral Goods**: Some merchandise is infected
- **The Broker's Eyes**: Nothing happens unobserved

## Notable Features

**The Auction Block**: Rotating sales of high-value data. Bidding wars can turn violent.

**Memory Merchants**: Sell and buy actual memories. Ethically questionable, highly profitable.

**The Leaderboard**: Rankings of top traders. Status symbol and target list.

**Dead Drops**: Anonymous exchange points. Popular for paranoid deals.

## Inhabitants

**The Broker**: Mysterious administrator. Never seen directly, communicates through proxies. Enforces neutrality ruthlessly.

**Regular Traders**: Mix of Virtual Adepts, Syndicate operatives, rogue Iteration X, and unaffiliated hackers.

**The Arbiters**: Enforcer programs that maintain order. Gray IC with personality.

**Ghosts**: Echoes of traders who died here. Some still try to make deals.

## Story Hooks

- The cabal needs specific data only available here—but someone's put a price on their heads
- A friend's memories are up for auction; can they be bought back?
- The Broker wants a favor in exchange for information, and favors here are never simple
- Something in the Junklands exit is calling to them
