# Francisca (Frankish Throwing Axe)

**Damage:** Str +2L | **Diff:** 7 | **Conceal:** J

## Concept
A curved throwing axe used by the Franks, designed to bounce unpredictably when it hits the ground before enemy lines. The psychological effect was as important as the wounds it caused.

| **Damage** | Strength + 2 |
| **Damage Type** | Lethal |
| **Concealability** | Jacket |

## Throwing Technique
Overhead throw with rotation. The curved head causes unpredictable bounces—historically thrown at the ground to ricochet into shield walls.

## Carrying Method
Belt loop or baldric. Warriors typically carried 2-4.

## Story Hooks
- Excavated from a dig site, it hungers for battle
- A collector's piece that belonged to a Merovingian king
