## What is a Thrown Weapon?

A Thrown Weapon is any object designed (or used) to be hurled at a target. Thrown weapons use Dexterity + Athletics to attack and typically add Strength to damage. Range is limited by the thrower's Strength.

## Thrown Weapon Statistics

### Difficulty
The base difficulty modifier. Standard throwing difficulty is 6.

### Damage
Usually adds to Strength, like melee weapons. Some specialized thrown weapons have fixed damage.

| Damage | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Str +0 | Small stones, darts |
| Str +1 | Throwing knives, shuriken |
| Str +2 | Throwing axes, spears |
| Str +3 | Heavy javelins, exceptional |

### Damage Type

| **Not Applicable** | N | Large spears, improvised |

### Range
Thrown weapon range is typically based on Strength:
- Short Range: Strength x 3 yards (no penalty)

- Long Range: Strength x 9 yards (+2 difficulty)

Some thrown weapons have range modifiers.

2. **Choose Category**: Knife, Star, Axe, Spear, or Improvised?

3. **Set Difficulty**: Based on aerodynamics and balance.

4. **Set Damage**: Based on size and design.

5. **Choose Damage Type**: Bashing or Lethal.

6. **Determine Concealability**: Based on size.

7. **Note Range Modifiers**: If different from standard.

8. **Describe the Weapon**: Appearance, history, feel.
