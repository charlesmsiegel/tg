## What is Hunter Gear?

Hunter Gear represents the specialized equipment and tools that hunters use to track, fight, and survive encounters with the supernatural. This includes weapons, armor, surveillance equipment, medical supplies, and other practical items. Unlike supernatural relics, gear is mundane technology - but in the hands of a skilled hunter, even mundane tools can make the difference between life and death.
