## What is a Charm?

A Charm is a Wonder designed for single use - once activated, its magic is expended and the item is typically destroyed or becomes mundane. Charms are easier to create than permanent Wonders and are often used for specific situations or as emergency measures.

## Charm Statistics

### Rank (0-10)
The power level of the Charm. Determines the effect's potency.

### Arete
Charms have their own Arete rating that determines how many dice are rolled when the effect is triggered. Typically equals Rank.

### Power
The magical Effect the Charm produces when used.

### Quintessence Cost
Some Charms require Quintessence to activate in addition to the stored magic.

### Resonance
The magical flavor of the Charm, should total at least Rank.

## Common Charm Forms

Charms take many forms depending on their creator's paradigm:

- **Potions/Elixirs** - Consumed liquids
- **Scrolls** - Written incantations (burned or read)
- **Talismans** - Objects broken or consumed
- **Gadgets** - Devices that burn out after use
- **Tokens** - Symbols or fetishes destroyed
- **Bullets/Ammunition** - Single-shot magical effects

## Charm Effects

Effects are defined by Spheres:

| Sphere Level | Effect Scope |
|--------------|--------------|
| 1 | Perception, minor protection |
| 2 | Basic manipulation |
| 3 | Significant effects |
| 4 | Major transformation |
| 5 | Mastery-level power |

The Charm's Rank typically equals the highest Sphere level required.
