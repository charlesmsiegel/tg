## What is a Mummy Relic?

A Mummy Relic is an ancient Egyptian magical artifact - items of power from the time of the pharaohs that have survived into the modern age. These relics were created by ancient priests and sorcerers, imbued with the power of the gods, and often tied to specific mummies or their purposes. They represent the Background: Artifact for Mummy characters.
