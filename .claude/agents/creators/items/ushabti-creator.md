## What is an Ushabti?

An Ushabti is an animated servant statue created through Hekau: Effigy or Ushabti magic. In ancient Egypt, ushabti were placed in tombs to serve the deceased in the afterlife. For Mummies, these figurines can be awakened to perform tasks, serve as guardians, or act as servants. They require Ba to animate and maintain.
