## What is a Wonder?

A Wonder is a magical item in Mage: The Ascension - an object imbued with magical power. Wonders range from simple enchanted trinkets to legendary artifacts of immense power. All Wonders share common statistics while specific subtypes (Talismans, Artifacts, Charms, Periapts, Grimoires) add their own mechanics.

## Wonder Statistics

### Rank (0-10)
The power level of the Wonder. Higher ranks mean more potent effects but also higher background costs and attention from other mages.

| Rank | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 0 | Trinket - Minor enchantment |
| 1 | Simple - Basic magical item |
| 2 | Minor - Useful Wonder |
| 3 | Moderate - Significant power |
| 4 | Major - Powerful item |
| 5 | Grand - Impressive Wonder |
| 6-10 | Legendary - Rare and potent |

### Background Cost (0-10)
The number of Background points required to possess this Wonder. Typically equals Rank for most Wonders.

### Quintessence Max (0-100)
