## What is a Fetish?

A Fetish is an item that has a spirit bound within it, granting the wielder supernatural powers. Fetishes are sacred to the Garou and represent a pact between the physical and spirit worlds. Creating a Fetish requires finding a willing (or coerced) spirit and binding it appropriately.

## Fetish Statistics

### Rank (1-5)
The power level of the Fetish, based on the spirit bound within.

| Rank | Description | Background Cost |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Minor spirit, simple power | 1 |
| 2 | Lesser spirit, useful ability | 2 |
| 3 | Moderate spirit, significant power | 3 |
| 4 | Greater spirit, powerful ability | 4 |
| 5 | Mighty spirit, legendary power | 5 |

### Gnosis
The spiritual energy of the Fetish. Used for activation rolls.
Typically equals Rank, but may vary.

### Spirit
The type of spirit bound within. The spirit's nature determines the Fetish's powers.

Common spirit types:
- **War Spirits** - Combat, aggression
- **Wisdom Spirits** - Knowledge, insight
- **Nature Spirits** - Elements, animals, plants
- **Ancestor Spirits** - Heritage, history
- **Elemental Spirits** - Fire, water, earth, air
- **Technology Spirits** - Weaver-touched items
- **Enigma Spirits** - Mysteries, puzzles

## Fetish Powers

Powers are determined by the bound spirit:
- **Combat Enhancement** - Damage, accuracy, defense
- **Spiritual Abilities** - Umbral travel, spirit sight
- **Elemental Control** - Fire, water, storms
- **Healing** - Regeneration, curing
- **Communication** - Translation, messaging
- **Detection** - Finding enemies, tracking
- **Transformation** - Shape-changing aids
- **Social** - Leadership, intimidation

## Fetish Activation

Most Fetishes require a Gnosis roll (difficulty 7) to activate.
- **Success**: Fetish works
- **Failure**: Fetish doesn't respond
- **Botch**: Spirit may be offended

Some Fetishes are always active or have different activation methods.
