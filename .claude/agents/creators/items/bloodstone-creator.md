## What is a Bloodstone?

A Bloodstone is a mystical item that can store vampire blood (vitae) for later use. These rare objects allow Kindred to carry extra blood points, transport blood safely, or preserve the vitae of powerful elders. Bloodstones are highly valued and jealously guarded.

## Bloodstone Statistics

### Blood Stored (Current)
How many blood points are currently in the stone.

### Max Blood
The maximum capacity of the Bloodstone. Varies by quality.

| Quality | Typical Max |
|---------|-------------|
| Minor | 5-10 |
| Moderate | 10-15 |
| Major | 15-20 |
| Legendary | 20+ |

### Is Active
Whether the Bloodstone is currently functional.

### Created By Generation
The generation of the vampire who created or empowered the stone. Lower generation = more potent blood.

### Stone Type
The physical form of the Bloodstone.
