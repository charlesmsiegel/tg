## What is a Reliquary?

A Reliquary is a physical location or object that a demon has bound themselves to, creating an anchor in the mortal world. Through a Reliquary, a demon can sense their surroundings, manifest their apocalyptic form, and maintain a presence even when their host is elsewhere. Reliquaries represent a significant investment of Faith.

### Health Levels
Maximum health = Faith + Willpower x 2 (typically 20 for standard).
