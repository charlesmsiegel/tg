## What is a Chantry?

A Chantry is a communal base of operations for mages - a protected space where willworkers can study, practice magick, and cooperate. Chantries range from small groups sharing an apartment to massive fortresses with extensive resources. Each faction has its own name for such places (Construct, Laboratory, Covenant, etc.).
