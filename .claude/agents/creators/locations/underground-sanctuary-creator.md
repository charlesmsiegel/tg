## What is an Underground Sanctuary?

An Underground Sanctuary is a hidden location where a mummy can rest, regenerate, and conduct their affairs away from mortal eyes. Unlike Tombs (which are ancient sacred sites), Sanctuaries are typically modern hideouts adapted to the contemporary world while maintaining connections to ancient Egyptian mysticism.
