## What is a Byway?

A Byway is a path through the Shadowlands and Tempest - a route that wraiths use to travel between locations in the Underworld. Byways can be ancient roads of the dead, storm-torn passages through the Tempest, or dangerous shortcuts through hostile territory.

3. **Assess Danger Level**: How hazardous is the journey?

4. **Determine Stability**: How reliable is the route?

5. **Rate Maelstrom Proximity**: How close to the storms?

6. **Rate Spectral Activity**: How many hostile entities?

7. **Note Features**: Waystations, patrols, haunting?

8. **Estimate Travel Time**: How long is the journey?
