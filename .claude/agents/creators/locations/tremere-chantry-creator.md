## What is a Tremere Chantry?

A Tremere Chantry is a fortified haven and mystical laboratory for Clan Tremere. Chantries serve as communal havens, research facilities, ritual spaces, and political bases for the Pyramid's local hierarchy. They are among the most secure locations in any city, protected by both mundane security and Thaumaturgical wards.
