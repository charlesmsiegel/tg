## What is a Nihil?

A Nihil is an opening in the fabric of the Underworld that leads to Oblivion - the ultimate nothingness that threatens to consume all existence. Nihils are among the most dangerous phenomena in the Shadowlands, draining Corpus, Pathos, and even memories from wraiths who venture too close.
